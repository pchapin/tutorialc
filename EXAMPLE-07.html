<h1>Example #7</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Standard Library String Handling Functions</p>

<p>In this example, I will create a program that demonstrates how some of the common standard
  library string functions work. This program will help explain how the functions work in two
  ways. First you will see the functions being used in the program. Second, the program itself is
  a demonstration program that illustrates to the user what, exactly, happens when the library
  string functions are used. You will definitely want to compile this program and try it out&mdash;even
  if you don't bother to look at the source code at all!</p>

<p>This program needs to be able to place text all over the screen in order to paint a clear and
  effective display. As a result, it uses the <a href="curses.txt">curses library</a>.
  Consequently it can only be compiled on a system that supports curses, such as Unix. Keep in
  mind, however, that the string functions its demonstrating are part of the standard library.</p>

<p>The final program is attached as <a href="samples/string_test.c">string_test.c</a>.</p>
