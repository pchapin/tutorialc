==================================

The following readings are from Stephen G. Kochan's "Programming in ANSI
C" (Revised edition, Sams Publishing, (C) 1994, ISBN=0-672-30339-6). You
can use Kochan's text to supplement my lessons and to get another
presentation of the material if you need or want it. I encourage you to
look at as many different books about C as you can to get the widest
possible vision of the material.

Lesson # 1: No reading in the text.

Lesson # 2: No reading in the text.

Lesson # 3: No reading in the text.

Lesson # 4: Read all of chapter 2 and all of chapter 3. (They are short).

Lesson # 5: You should read all of chapter 4 while working through this
            lesson and the next one. Also check out pages 414 to 415,
            section 4.2.

Lesson # 6: Finish chapter 4. See table A.3 on page 423 for a precedence
            chart. 

Lesson # 7: During this lesson and the next you should read in Chapter
            6, from page 71 to page 92. (Stop at the section on the
            switch statement).

Lesson # 8: Finish reading in chapter 6 up to page 92. Also start
            reading chapter 5. You should read all of chapter 5 during
            this lesson and the next.

Lesson # 9: Finish reading chapter 5.

Lesson #10: Finish reading chapter 6, starting on page 92 with the
            switch statement. You don't need to worry about the
            conditional operator.

Lesson #11: No reading in the text.

Lesson #12: No reading in the text.

Lesson #13: No reading in the text.

Lesson #14: Read in chapter 8, pages 128 to 147.

Lesson #15: Read in chapter 8, pages 162 to 165.

Lesson #16: Read in chapter 8, page 166 to the top of 169.

Lesson #17: Read all of chapter 15 (it's fairly small).

Lesson #18: Read all of chapter 7 except the section on multidimensional
            arrays starting on page 121.

Lesson #19: Kochan describes pointers in chapter 11, after he has
            already talked about structures and strings. I prefer doing
            it the other way around. Thus we will be skipping over quite
            a bit of chapter 11 right now and returning to it again
            later. In addition, I've split the material in chapter 11
            that we can cover now into three lessons (19 to 21). For
            this lesson, read pages 245 to 251, 280 to 284, and 286 to
            287.

Lesson #20: Read the section in chapter 11 on pointers and arrays. It
            starts on page 270 and goes to page 276.

Lesson #21: In chapter 11 read the section on pointers and functions
            starting on page 264 and ending on page 270. Kochan uses
            structures in some of his examples. Since we haven't talked
            about structures yet, you can just skim over those parts.

Lesson #22: During this lesson and the next read over chapter 10 from
            page 203 to page 228. Also note the list of standard string
            handling functions in Appendix B on page 454.

Lesson #23: Continue the reading described in the last lesson.

Lesson #24: In chapter 16, read pages 378 to 388.

Lesson #25: In chapter 17, read the section on command line arguments on
            pages 398 to 402.

Lesson #26: During this lesson and the next you should read all of
            Chapter 9.

Lesson #27: Finish reading chapter 9.

Lesson #28: All of chapter 13.

Lesson #29: Read in chapter 12 from page 291 to page 306. Don't bother
            with the section on bit fields.

Lesson #30: Read about the typedef statement in Chapter 14 on pages 341
            to 344.
