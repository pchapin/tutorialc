<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many students in VTC's C and C++ programming classes ask about how they can get a compiler to
  use on their own system. Although the compilers used by VTC can't (normally) be installed on
  student machines, there are a number of free options available to students. It is the purpose of
  this document to describe those options. Note that this document assumes you are using a Windows
  system. If you have a personal Linux system, you certainly have access to the GCC compiler. This
  document does not discuss options for Apple systems</p>
<p>The compilers are listed below in order of increasing "heaviness". The first compiler on the
  list is relatively small and simple. The later compilers are larger and, typically more
  complicated to install and use. All of these compilers can be downloaded and installed for no
  charge.</p>

<h3>Legal Status</h3>
<p>LCC-Win32 is free for <em>personal, non-commercial</em> use. If you sell the software you
  produce with LCC-Win32 or use it in a corporation (including a classroom) you must buy a
  license. However, the author has informed me in email that "personal use" includes students
  using it on their own machines... even if such usage is to do programming assignments. See the
  LCC-Win32 web site (URL below) for more information.</p>
<p>The author of LCC-Win32 suggested to me that students consider buying the CD-ROM distribution
  of the system. In addition to sparing you the trouble of downloading all the files, the CD-ROM
  distribution comes with numerous examples that might be of interest. It also helps to support
  the LCC-Win32 development effort.</p>
<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
<p>The main LCC-Win32 site is <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/"
>http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/</a>. Go there to download the latest version of the
  system. LCC-Win32 is updated frequently.</p>
<p>There are several files you can download but not all of them are necessary.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>lccwin32.exe</b>. This is the base system. It is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>manual.exe</b>. This is the documentation for the compiler product and its tools. You
      should download this as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>tutorial.pdf</b>. This is an extensive C tutorial. It covers the basics of C as well as
      a number of advanced topics. It also discusses how to use LCC-Win32 to develop graphical
      Windows applications. You might consider downloading this document to use as a supplement to
      your text book or class notes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>win32hlp.exe</b>. This is the Windows API documentation. It is only necessary if you
      plan on developing graphical Windows applications and don't have access to API documentation
      from any other source. You do <em>not</em> need this file for writing standard, ANSI C
      programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>lccdoc.exe</b>. This is technical documentation on the internal design of the LCC-Win32
      compiler and tools. It is <em>not</em> necessary for writing programs. The documents in this
      file are all in Microsoft Word format. This file also contains the documentation in
      manual.exe (in Word format).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the files I mentioned above (except for the PDF file) are InstallShield executables.
  Just double click on the file to install it. You will be asked where to install the product. The
  usual location is <span class="filename">c:\lcc</span>. Whatever location you choose you should
  probably be consistent and use the same location for each component. If you want to use the
  command line tools, you will need to manually add the LCC bin directory to the path. Exactly how
  to do that depends on your operating environment.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>WinNT (Win2k/WinXP ??)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Open the control panel and double click on the "System" icon. Click on the environment tab
      and then select "Path" in the "User Variable" section that appears. If you are logged in as
      Administrator and want the change to occur for ever user, you can modify the path in the
      "System Variable" section. Add <span class="filename"
      >c:\lcc\bin</span> to the end of the list of folders presented there (use a semicolon
      between folder names), click "Set", and then close the system property sheet. Open a fresh
      command prompt to get an environment containing the change. It should not be necessary to
      reboot the system.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>To access the documentation you may want to manually create a shortcut to the <span
    class="filename">lcc.chm</span> file (probably in the <span class="filename">c:\lcc\doc
        folder</span>). You may also want to manually create shortcuts to the <span
    class="filename">c-library.chm</span> file (probably in <span class="filename"
>c:\lcc\bin</span>) and the <span class="filename">strlib.chm</span> file (also probably in <span
    class="filename">c:\lcc\bin</span>). Note that most of this documentation is accessible from
  the help menu of the IDE should you choose to do your development using the IDE (see below).</p>
<h3>Compiling Programs</h3>
<p>To compile short, simple programs you will probably find the command line tools to be the
  easiest to use. Use any text editor (PFE, XEmacs, etc) to create your program. Open a command
  prompt and use the cd command to change to the folder containing your program. The commands
  below assume that the program is named hello.c</p>
<pre>
C:\home\peter&gt; lcc hello.c
C:\home\peter&gt; lcclnk hello.obj
</pre>
<p>Notice that you must use two commands to create your executable file. To run the program just
  type its name</p>
<pre>
C:\home\peter&gt; hello
</pre>
<p>I suggest that you write a program that uses printf to print "Hello, World" on the console and
  then use the commands above to compile and run it. That will give you confidence that you have
  installed LCC-Win32 properly.</p>
<h3>Using the Integrated Development Environment</h3>
<p>If you are building a large program (especially one consisting of many source files) you might
  want to use the IDE instead of the command line tools. You might also find the IDE more
  interesting and more fun to use. However, the IDE is also a lot more complicated. If you find
  the IDE confusing and difficult, stay away from it. The command line tools are sufficient to get
  the job done.</p>
<p>If you do want to use the IDE, you need to be aware of several points.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The IDE organizes your programs in terms of projects. Each project can consist of many
      source files along with various compiler options that are set uniquely for that project.
      Each project generates a single executable file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to your source files, the IDE will create some control files pertaining to your
      project. This is normal so don't be alarmed to discover several "strange" files along with
      your program files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each project must reside in its own folder. You can't put two projects in the same folder
      due to name conflicts on certain control files.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you want to use the IDE to build the "Hello, World" program. Follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start the IDE. It is called Wedit. A shortcut to it should have been added to your start
      menu when you installed LCC-Win32.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pull down the project menu and select "Create...". In the dialog box that appears, enter a
      name for your project. For example, you might enter "hello". Be sure to enter the project's
      working directory (folder). Wedit will create it if it doesn't exist. Most likely you'll
      want to use a folder that doesn't exist when you create a new project. The output directory
      (folder)is where the output files will go, such as the executable file. I suggest making
      that the same as the project's working directory. Verify the other settings in this dialog
      box... particularly the "Type of project" setting. For simple programs you want "Console
      Application".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you press "Create" you will be asked if you want to use a wizard to generate the
      application's skeleton. Say "no".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next you will be asked to select source files for the project. You can type the name of a
      file that does not exist (yet) at this point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have added all the source files you care about (for a simple program there will
      be only one), press the "OK" button. You will then be presented with several dialog boxes of
      compiler settings. For simple programs, all the defaults are acceptable. You might review
      the settings anyway just as a matter of interest. You can change them later if you wish. You
      might want to select "Warning level: All" if you are just learning C. Compiler warnings can
      often help you find bugs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you press "Finished" the IDE creates a special control file in your project's working
      directory named "Makefile". This file defines how the various files composing your project
      are compiled and linked. Do not delete it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are now ready to edit your source file(s) using the integrated editor. When you want to
      create the executable, press the F9 key or select "Make" from the "Compiler" menu.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that when you exit Wedit, it remembers which project was open and it will automatically
  reopen that project when you next start Wedit. That is sometimes useful, sometimes annoying.
  When you are done working with a project, you should probably explicitly close it by selecting
  "Close..." from the "Project" menu.</p>
<p>It may sound like using the IDE is a big hassle, but actually once you get used to it the
  process is pretty straightforward. You may find that you soon like the IDE and want to use it
  all the time.</p>
