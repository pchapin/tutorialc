<h3>What is a function?</h3>
<p>I could give you a mathematical definition of a function using words like "domain" and "range"
  and "mapping". However, I'll skip that and jump right to a more practical way of looking at
  functions&mdash;at least from a programming point of view.</p>
<p>Functions are like black boxes. They take inputs, do something, and then spit out results. Here
  is a picture.</p>
<pre class="figure">
                            +----------+
             x   -----&gt;     |          |
                            |          |
             y   -----&gt;     |  func()  |     -----&gt; result
                            |          |
             z   -----&gt;     |          |
                            +----------+
</pre>
<p>I show a function named <span class="code">func</span> that takes three inputs named <span
    class="code">x</span>, <span class="code">y</span>, and <span class="code"
>z</span> and returns a result named <span class="code">result</span>. Technically functions only
  return one result but there are tricks you can use to, in effect, get them to return several
  results.</p>
<p>The function performs some operation using the input values. Exactly how it does what it does
  is of no concern to the user of the function. In that respect it is like a black box. When you
  use a function you are only concerned about providing it with appropriate inputs, understanding
  what operation it performs, and knowing the meaning of its result. What goes on inside the box
  is not important.</p>
<p>When you write a function you also need to understand the meaning of the inputs, what operation
  is to be performed, and the meaning of the result. However, you don't need to worry about where
  the inputs are coming from and where the result is going. You only need to worry about making
  the function do what it is supposed to do. In this way, functions break up the work of creating
  a program. Like so</p>
<table border="1" style="text-align: center;">
  <tr>
    <th>Function User</th>
    <th>Function Creator</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Does not worry about how it works.</td>
    <td>Does not worry about how it will be used.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Only thinks about how to make use of the function.</td>
    <td>Only thinks about how to make the function work.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The "interface" to the function is an agreement between the user and the creator. The interface
  consists of</p>
<ol>
  <li>A description of the function's inputs and their meaning.</li>
  <li>A description of what the function is supposed to do.</li>
  <li>A description of the function's results and their meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading and understanding the interface, the user of a function knows everything he/she
  needs to know about how to use the function effectively. After reading and understanding the
  interface, the creator of a function knows exactly what he/she must make the function do. The
  interface is like a contract between the user and the creator (the creator is also called the
  "implementer" in some circles).</p>
<h3>Why functions?</h3>
<p>Functions are very important. So far your programs have consisted of a single function named
  <span class="code">main</span>. However, larger programs are always composed of many functions.
  Sometimes there are literally thousands of functions in a program! The act of programming is, to
  a large extent, the act of writing various functions.</p>
<p>Each function by itself is small and simple. This makes it a lot easier to write an individual
  function correctly. The functions use each other, however, so the final program is still large
  and complex. Yet when you work with the program you don't have to worry about 99.99% of it at
  any one time. Most of the time, you only need to worry about one, small function. Without a
  facility like this, it would be nearly impossible to write a large program. All programming
  languages have this feature.</p>
<p>Actually, even the programs you have written so far have made use of functions. In particular,
  you have used <span class="code">printf</span> and <span class="code"
  >scanf</span> from the C standard library. These functions were written by someone else (most
  likely in C), but you are able to use them without knowing anything about how they work
  internally. This is another positive aspect of functions: you can share them. All C compilers
  come with a "standard" library of functions. However, you can buy (or download) additional
  libraries to suit your needs. If you can't find a suitable library, you can always write your
  own. C has very little built into it. The language depends on libraries of functions to get
  things done.</p>
<p>Occasionally students ask me if C is good for graphical programming. The language itself has no
  facilities for graphical programming at all. Yet with a good library of graphical functions, it
  is easy to write graphical programs. Ironically the fact that the language has very little built
  into it is an advantage. It allows libraries the room to try various improvements. There is no
  one way to do graphical programming in C. How it works, what you can do, and how easily, all
  depend on the library you are using. Different libraries can cater to different needs.</p>
<p>So why use functions? Here are the reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Functions allow you to break a large program into smaller parts that can be more easily
      understood. Without this ability it would be impossible to create a large program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functions allow you to share and reuse code. You can build on the work and expertise of
      others by using functions they wrote that you might not have been able to create on your
      own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functions allow you to extend the language. By creating libraries for specific purposes you
      can, in effect, add more features to C and make the language suitable for new types of
      applications.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Those are three very strong reasons for using functions! From now on you will use functions a
  lot.</p>
<h3>Okay, time for an example</h3>
<p>Let's take an example from one of the earlier sample programs. I've played around with a few
  programs that test numbers to see if they are prime. The ability to check a number for primehood
  might be useful in other programs. Perhaps we should write a function to do that. Here is one
  way it might look.</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int number)
{
  int i;

  // Very small numbers are errors. Errors are not prime.
  if (number &lt; 2) return 0;

  // Otherwise, just check all numbers less than number for divisability.
  for (i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
    if (number % i == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  // If I got here the number must be prime.
  return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>This is called a "function definition". It consists of a "function header" followed by a
  "function body". The body is the part inside the curly braces. The body defines exactly what the
  function does. The header is the part that looks like</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int number)
</pre>
<p>It is the part of the interface that the compiler cares about. The first thing on the line
  (<span class="code">int</span>) is the type of the function's result. This function returns an
  integer. The second thing (<span class="code">is_prime</span>) is the function's name. The third
  thing (<span class="code">int number</span>) is a declaration of the function's "parameters".
  The parameters are the function's inputs. In this case the function takes only one parameter,
  which I am calling <span class="code">number</span> and it is of type integer.</p>
<p>There is another part to the function's interface that does not show up here. Namely: a
  description of the meaning of the parameter, what the function does, and the meaning of the
  result. This information is not part of the header, because the compiler isn't concerned about
  it. However, the user of the function is very concerned about it! Here is that part:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This function checks to see if its parameter is a prime number or not. It returns zero
    (false) if the parameter is not prime and non-zero (true) if it is. Numbers less than 2 are
    not considered prime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without this information it would be impossible for the user to understand how to use the
  function. Notice that the description above does not say a word about <em>how</em> the function
  does what it does. The user is not interested in "how". The user is only interested in "what".
</p>
<p>For example, you can tell by looking at the function that it returns 1 if it is given a prime
  number. Yet the description above merely says "non-zero". This means that a future version of
  this function might, perhaps, return something different. The implementor is reserving the right
  to upgrade and change the way the function works. As long as the user depends on the more vauge
  "non-zero" description, the user's program will continue to work even after the function has
  been upgraded. This is very important: you don't want to depend on the undocumented behavior of
  a function. That behavior is likely to change with the next release.</p>
<p>When you write your own functions, you must provide the description as a comment in your
  program. Without proper documentation, a function is useless. The description is not required by
  the compiler, but it is required by me.</p>
<p>How would <span class="code">is_prime</span> be used? Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="code">
int main(void)
{
  int my_number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;my_number);

  // Print out an appropriate message.
  if (is_prime(my_number)) {
    printf("The number, %d, is prime!\n", my_number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is not prime!\n", my_number);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Notice how simple this program looks? It asks for a number, uses <span class="code"
>is_prime</span> to check it, and prints out a message telling the user what happened. What could
  be more straightforward? All the hard work has been pushed into the function. When you write the
  main program, you don't need to worry about how <span class="code"
  >is_prime</span> works. You only need to know that it does work---and how to use it. Similarly
  when you write <span class="code">is_prime</span>, you don't need to worry about how it will be
  used. You can focus your mind exclusively on making it work properly and honoring its interface.
  This is the separation of concerns I was talking about before. It is extremely important!</p>
<p>What's more, you now have a function you can use to test a number for primehood. Maybe you'll
  write another program later where you will want to do that. If so, you don't need to think at
  all about how to make that test. Just include the <span class="code"
  >is_prime</span> function and use it. Furthermore if someone else you know needs to test numbers
  for primehood you could just give them <span class="code">is_prime</span> (or sell it to them)
  and they could use it as well. Cool, huh?</p>
<p>Of course, the <span class="code">is_prime</span> I show above is pretty simple minded. Who
  would want it? Maybe nobody would want that version. But that might not always be true. You
  could enhance <span class="code">is_prime</span> using some of the techniques I talked about in
  my earlier example. Or... you could use even more sophisticated techniques. With a little study
  it would be possible to build a version of <span
      class="code">is_prime</span> that was exceedingly fast without changing its interface at
  all. Thus any program that uses <span class="code">is_prime</span> could be upgraded to the very
  fast version without otherwise being modified. The ability to replace a function with a new and
  improved version is also a big advantage to using functions.</p>
<h3>But wait! How does the main program know about <span class="code">is_prime</span>?</h3>
<p>Let me now show you the complete example</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/*
 * int is_prime(int)
 *
 * This function tests its parameter to see if it is prime. It returns
 * "false" if it is not and "true" if it is. This function treats any
 * number less than 2 as not prime.
 *
 */
int is_prime(int number)
{
  int i;

  // Very small numbers are errors. Errors are not prime.
  if (number &lt; 2) return 0;

  // Otherwise, just check all numbers less than number for divisability.
  for (i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
    if (number % i == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  // If we got here the number must be prime.
  return 1;
}


/*==================================*/
/*           Main Program           */
/*==================================*/

int main(void)
{
  int my_number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;my_number);

  // Print out an appropriate message.
  if (is_prime(my_number)) {
    printf("The number, %d, is prime!\n", my_number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is not prime!\n", my_number);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, I have put the function definition above <span class="code">main</span>. This
  is often a good place for it. The compiler will want to see <span class="code"
  >is_prime</span> before you try to use it in main. If the compiler sees you using a function it
  never heard of, bad things might happen (in C++ it is an error. In C it works only if the
  function returns an integer). Notice how I have also included a comment block on the function
  that describes it. That comment block is an essential part of the function. It provides the part
  of the interface that the user needs to know but that the compiler doesn't care about. Including
  such comment blocks is part of the VTC style.</p>
<p>It turns out that I can optionally put the function after <span class="code">main</span> as
  well. However, if I do that I need to place a "declaration" of the function before main. The
  declaration is just the function's header with a semicolon at the end.</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int number);
</pre>
<p>This line informs the compiler that <span class="code">is_prime</span> is a function and tells
  the compiler what it needs to know about the function. The actual definition of the function can
  be elsewhere.</p>
<p>When you write a function declaration it is acceptable to leave out the name of the paramter.
  This is often done.</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int);
</pre>
<p>The full program thus becomes</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int is_prime(int);

/*==================================*/
/*           Main Program           */
/*==================================*/

int main(void)
{
  int my_number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;my_number);

  // Print out an appropriate message.
  if (is_prime(my_number)) {
    printf("The number, %d, is prime!\n", my_number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is not prime!\n", my_number);
  }

  return 0;
}


/*
 * int is_prime(int)
 *
 * This function tests its parameter to see if it is prime. It returns
 * "false" if it is not and "true" if it is. This function treats any
 * number less than 2 as not prime.
 *
 */
int is_prime(int number)
{
  int i;

  // Very small numbers are errors. Errors are not prime.
  if (number &lt; 2) return 0;

  // Otherwise, just check all numbers less than Number for divisability.
  for (i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
    if (number % i == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  // If we got here the number must be prime.
  return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>Notice how I've replaced the function definition with a declaration and moved the full
  definition below main. This is a common method for laying out programs. The important thing is
  that the compiler sees the declaration or definition of a function before you try to use it.
  This is exactly what you are doing when you <span class="code">#include
        &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>. You are showing the compiler declarations of various functions in
  the standard library before you try to use them.</p>
<p>Notice something else: I called the parameter of <span class="code">is_prime</span> "number"
  and yet in <span class="code">main</span> I'm giving it a variable named "my_number". Is that
  correct?</p>
<h3>Pass by value!</h3>
<p>This topic is so important that I need to start a new section to describe it. In C, function
  arguments are "passed by value". The "argu- ment" you give to a function when you use it is
  copied and the copy is used to initialize the parameter. In my example above, a copy of <span
      class="code">my_number</span> is made and that copy initializes <span
      class="code">number</span>. When <span class="code">is_prime</span> is executing, any
  changes it makes to <span class="code">number</span> will have no effect on the original value
  of <span class="code">my_number</span>. This is sometimes a handy thing. At other times it is
  awkward. The important thing is for you to understand what is happening!</p>
<p>I say again: the arguments you give to a function when you call it are <em>copied</em>. Those
  copies are used to initialize the function's corresponding parameters. If the function modifies
  one of its parameters while it runs, those modifications do not affect the original arguments.
</p>
<p>Don't forget this!</p>
<p>Some languages have a feature called "pass by reference". It works differently. C does not have
  pass by reference so you should not worry about it. When you study a language that does support
  pass by reference, you will need to pay close attention to how it works. For now, just remember
  that in C function arguments are <em>always</em> passed by value.</p>
<h3>What about errors?</h3>
<p>In <span class="code">is_prime</span> I just return "false" if I'm given a value less than 2.
  In previous programs, I treated such values as errors and printed an appropriate message. The
  program above will just say that such a value is not prime.</p>
<p>What you should do in a function when you see an error situation is not always clear. In
  general, if you plan on ever using your function in a different program, you should <em>not</em>
  print out an error message in your function. A message that is appropriate for one program may
  not be appropriate for another. Instead such functions usually return a special value called an
  "error code" to indicate that something went wrong. It then becomes up to the caller of the
  function to check the value it returns to see if it is the error code. The caller can then deal
  with the error or perhaps return an error code of its own to its caller!</p>
<p>On the other hand if your function will never be used in another program it is often acceptable
  to have the function deal with the error on the spot. The problem is that functions you think
  are specific to your application have a way of becoming general purpose. Knowing exactly how to
  deal with errors in your functions is difficult and much has been written on the subject. This
  is a matter that you will encounter many times in the future as you expand your programming
  skills.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>A function is a reusable chunk of code. In general a function accepts inputs, called
      "parameters," does something interesting and worthwhile, and finally returns a result. The
      user of a function does not need to worry about how it works. The implementor of a function
      does not need to worry about how it will be used. Functions give you a way of sharing your
      work with others. They can be upgraded without forcing the rest of your program to change.
      They provide you with a way of breaking your program down into small, managable parts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A function declaration is just the header of the function followed by a semicolon. The
      header contains the return type, the name, and the declaration of the parameters. A function
      definition is the header followed by the function's body inside curly braces. The body is
      where you specify exactly what the function does. The compiler must see either the
      definition or a declaration for a function before you try to use it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In C you can pass any appropriately typed variable into a function (in other words, if the
      function takes an integer parameter, you can send it any integer variable you like). The
      variable you give to the function, called its "argument" is copied and the copy is used to
      initialize the corresponding "parameter" in the function's definition. This is called "pass
      by value" and it is the only way arguments are passed to functions in C.</p>
