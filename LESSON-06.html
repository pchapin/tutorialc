<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>Binary operators</h3>

<p>An "operator" is a special symbol that causes the program to perform a certain operation. The
  values that are operated upon are called "operands". For example, in the statement</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;
</pre>

<p>The values stored in <span class="code">y</span> and <span class="code">z</span> are the
  operands to the <span class="code">+</span> operator. The <span class="code">+</span> operator
  is an example of a "binary" operator. It is called binary because it takes two operands. There
  are several other binary operators in C. The most important are</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;  // Addition
  x = y - z;  // Subtraction
  x = y * z;  // Multiplication
  x = y / z;  // Division
  x = y % z;  // Modulus
</pre>

<p>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all as you would expect. The last two require
  some more explaination.</p>

<p>When two integers are divided the result is just the quotent. The fractional part is thrown
  away. For example 5/2 is 2, not 2.5 like you might expect. Similarly 15/4 is 3, not 3.75. The
  significance of this is that the division of integers yields another integer. Furthermore the
  result is <em>not</em> rounded off. This was done on purpose. It is much faster than computing a
  result using floating point numbers. Also, believe it or not, it is often exactly what you want.
</p>

<p>It is important to know that when you divide floating point numbers (variables of type float,
  double, or long double), the result is a floating point number. That is, 5.0/2.0 is 2.5 just as
  you might expect (except that it might really be something like 2.50000000013298213). Notice
  that I typed an explict decimal place to indicate a floating point value. The C compiler
  understands this. If you put a "5" in your program, the compiler treats it as an integer. If you
  put a "5.0" in your program, the compiler treats it as a double.</p>

<p>The modulus operator might be unfamiliar to you. It computes the integer remainder after doing
  integer division. For example, 11/4 yields a quotent of 2 and a remainder of 3. Thus 11 % 4 is 3
  (the remainder). Division and modulus are thus two sides of the same operation. You can see how
  they relate with this chart.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>0/3 is 0</td>
    <td>0%3 is 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1/3 is 0</td>
    <td>1%3 is 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2/3 is 0</td>
    <td>2%3 is 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/3 is 1</td>
    <td>3%3 is 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4/3 is 1</td>
    <td>4%3 is 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5/3 is 1</td>
    <td>5%3 is 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6/3 is 2</td>
    <td>6%3 is 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7/3 is 2</td>
    <td>7%3 is 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8/3 is 2</td>
    <td>8%3 is 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>etc...</td>
    <td>etc...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>C has other binary operators besides the five I've shown here, but these are commonly used and
  will be enough for the moment.</p>

<h3>Unary operators</h3>

<p>A unary operator is an operator that has only one operand. The only one we will worry about
  right now is unary minus. For example</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = -y;
</pre>

<p>This takes the value of <span class="code">y</span>, negates it, and puts the result into <span
    class="code">x</span>. There is also a unary plus, but nobody uses it because it doesn't do
  anything. It exists in the language purely for symmetry with unary minus.</p>

<p>C has quite a few other unary operators that we will discuss as we come to them.</p>

<h3>The assignment operator</h3>

<p>First, consider this statement</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y;
</pre>

<p>The assignment operator is a binary operator because it requires two operands. The operand on
  the right is the value that is being copied. The operand on the left is the place the copy is
  going. Assignment is special because the left operand can't be just anything. It must refer to
  something that exists in the program's memory. Consider</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;
</pre>

<p>This is fine. The value of <span class="code">y + z</span> is computed and that value is put
  into <span class="code">x</span>.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x + y = z;
</pre>

<p>Error! I can't put the value of <span class="code">z</span> into <span class="code">x +
    y</span> because there is no place in memory associated with <span class="code">x +
    y</span>.</p>

<p>In C techno-babble we say that assignment's left operand must be an "lvalue". The "l" in
  "lvalue" comes from "left". C is rather unique in the way it handles assignment. In most
  languages assignment is handled by a statement, not an operator. This is an subtle technical
  distinction, but it means that C (and C++) need to define the concept of "lvalue" while most
  other languages can ignore the whole issue. How important is this to us? Not very. However, you
  will probably eventually get an error message from the compiler that says something like "lvalue
  required". It would be nice if you had some idea of what it was talking about!</p>

<h3>Expressions</h3>

<p>It is important to understand that, except for assignment's left operand, none of the operators
  we've looked at so far modify their operands. Let's look at that again:</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;
</pre>

<p>This computes the sum of <span class="code">y</span> and <span class="code">z</span>, BUT
  neither <span class="code">y</span> nor <span class="code">z</span> is changed by that. The
  value of <span class="code">x</span> is changed but that's because assignment has the special
  feature that it modifies it's left operand (that's why that operand must be an lvalue).</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = -y;
</pre>

<p>Here the negation of <span class="code">y</span> is computed and that result is put into <span
    class="code">x</span>, but the value of <span class="code">y</span> is not changed. Most
  operators are like this. With only a few special exceptions, they do not modify their operands.
</p>

<p>As a result of this, complicated expressions can be created by combining simplier ones using
  parentheses. For example</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = (z1 + z2) / (z1 - z2);
</pre>

<p>Here the left operand of <span class="code">/</span> is the result of computing <span
    class="code">z1 + z2</span>. The right operand of <span class="code">/</span> is the result of
  computing <span class="code">z1 - z2</span>. The result of the final division is then put into
  <span class="code">x</span>. The values of <span class="code">z1</span> and <span
      class="code">z2</span> are not changed by any of this. Only <span class="code">x</span> is
  changed.</p>

<p>The fact that the operators don't modify their operands is important to make things like this
  work. What if <span class="code">/</span> modified its operands? In that case, it would be
  trying to modify <span class="code">z1 + z2</span>. That would be sort of like trying to do</p>

<pre class="code">
  z1 + z2 = x;
</pre>

<p>It doesn't make sense! Thankfully that is not what's happening and the expression makes
  perfectly good sense. You can write expressions that are as large and nasty as you want. Any
  good C compiler should be able to handle anything no matter how complex it gets. There are no
  limits.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = ((z1 + z2) * (z1 - z2)) / ((x + y) / 2);
</pre>

<p>Here the left operand of <span class="code">/</span> is the result of multiplying <span
    class="code">z1 + z2</span> by <span class="code">z1 - z2</span>. The right operand of <span
    class="code">/</span> is the result of computing <span class="code">(x + y) / 2</span>. Notice
  that this statement uses the value of <span class="code">x</span> and assigns to the value of
  <span class="code">x</span>. This is not a problem. The original value of <span
      class="code">x</span> is used to compute the new result and then that new value is assigned
  to <span class="code">x</span>. This is very much like what happens in this statement</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = x + 1;
</pre>

<p>Notice also that I used spacing in such a way as to make the grouping of subexpressions clear.
  I believe that you should include spaces around binary operators, including assignment, but not
  around unary operators. You should avoid putting spaces after '(' or before ').'</p>

<h3>Precedence</h3>

<p>I've been writing</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;
</pre>

<p>without any parentheses. How can I get away with that? There are two binary operators in that
  statement: plus and assignment. Which one is computed first? Does it matter? In general it does
  matter. First consider:</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = (y + z);
</pre>

<p>This is what I want to happen. It is legal and reasonable. Now consider:</p>

<pre class="code">
  (x = y) + z;
</pre>

<p>Strangely this happens to also be legal. In C the value of an assignment operation is the value
  of the left operand after the assignment occured. Thus this statement assigns <span
      class="code">y</span> to <span class="code">x</span> and then computes the sum of <span
      class="code">z</span> and the new value of <span class="code">x</span>. The result of that
  addition is then thrown away. In short, the statement is legal but doesn't make a whole lot of
  sense.</p>

<p>It happens that the version I want is what I will get. This is because the addition operator
  has higher "precedence" than assignment. When those two operators compete for the same operands,
  addition will win. It is done first.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y + z;
  //  ^ Both + and = want this operand. Addition wins. More precedence.
</pre>

<p>In your mind, visualize the statement like this</p>

<pre class="code">
  x     =     y+z;
</pre>

<p>The addition operator bonds to its operands more tightly than assignment.</p>

<p>Now take a look at this statement</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a + b / c;
</pre>

<p>Does this add <span class="code">a</span> to the quotient of <span
    class="code">b/c</span> or does it divide <span class="code">c</span> into the sum of <span
    class="code">a+b</span>? In other words are we getting</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a + (b / c);
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="code">
x = (a + b) / c;
</pre>

<p>This is a very important question because, mathematically, the two computations are very
  different. The answer is that we are getting</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a + (b / c);
</pre>

<p>This is because division has higher precedence than addition. Visualize the statement like
  this</p>

<pre class="code">
  x     =     a  +  b/c;
</pre>

<p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence which is higher than addition or
  subtraction. Addition and subtraction have the same precedence which is higher than assignment.
  Every operator has a precedence level. Knowing these levels for the commonly used operators is
  important. Consult your text for a complete list of all of C's operators and their relative
  precedence.</p>

<p>But what happens when an expression involves two operators with the same precedence? Check out
  this example</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a + b + c;
</pre>

<p>In this case you need to consider the associativity of the operators. Checking a precedence
  chart I see that addition associates from left to right. Thus the above statement becomes</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = ((a + b) + c);
</pre>

<p>In other words, the leftmost operation is done first. Now it happens that it doesn't really
  matter for addition since addition is mathematically associative (it might matter in real life
  if there was a possibility of overflow). But what about this case</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a / b * c;
</pre>

<p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence. Yet</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = (a / b) * c;
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = a / (b * c);
</pre>

<p>are very different! Checking a precedence chart I see that multiplication and division
  associate from left to right. Thus I get</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = (a / b) * c;
</pre>

<p>If I want the other option I can add explicit parentheses. You can always override the
  precedence or associativity of an operator by using parentheses. Since parentheses never hurt,
  feel free to include them when you are in doubt about the interpretation of an expression.
  Nevertheless knowing some of the basic rules is a must.</p>

<h3>Sample program</h3>

<p>Attached to this lesson is a sample program named <a href="prec.c">prec.c</a>. You should
  compile that program and try it out. It asks you to enter three integers. It then computes
  various expressions using those integers and prints out the results. Be sure you understand why
  the results are what they are.</p>

<p>Notice how in the sample program I declared a single integer named <span
    class="code">result</span> to hold the results of each computation. Since I print out one
  result before calculating the next, there is no reason why I can't reuse the <span
      class="code">result</span> variable. It is very important to understand that the
  instructions in a program execute in a certain sequence. The machine does one step at a time
  moving from the first line of the program toward the last.</p>

<h3>A few other useful operators</h3>

<p>The C language has a few "shortcut" operators for commonly needed operations. Consider the
  statement</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = x + 1;
</pre>

<p>The point of this statement is to add one to <span class="code">x</span> and replace <span
    class="code">x</span> with the new value. This sort of thing is so common that C has a special
  version of the assignment operator for it.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x += 1;
</pre>

<p>Do not put a space between the '+' and the '='. Unlike the other operators we have seen so far,
  this operator is two characters.</p>

<p>In addition to <span class="code">+=</span>, there are also similar operators for the other
  math operations.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x += y;         // Like x = x + y;
  x -= y;         // Like x = x - y;
  x *= y;         // Like x = x * y;
  x /= y;         // Like x = x / y;
  x %= y;         // Like x = x % y;
</pre>

<p>Think of these operations as "in place" operations. As with ordinary assignment they modify
  their left operand. In this case they make the modification by "blending in" the right operand
  according to the appropriate operation.</p>

<p>For a while these in place operations were peculiar to C. Other languages, like Pascal, don't
  have them. However, C has been a very influential language. Many newer languages have similar
  operators because C programmers expect them. They can be very handy. When you get used to them,
  you will really like them.</p>

<h3>Increment and decrement</h3>

<p>Adding or subtracting one from the value of a variable is so common that C provides special
  operators just for that purpose.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x  = x + 1;     // You're a Pascal programmer, right?
  x += 1;         // Not really the way it would be done in C.
  x++;            // That's more like it!
</pre>

<p>To subtract one from a variable, use --.</p>

<pre class="code">
  x--;
</pre>

<p>These statements look a little strange because there is no equals sign in them. The <span
    class="code">++</span> operator (increment) and the <span class="code">--</span> operator
  (decrement) modify their operands directly. In other words you don't want to say</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = x++;        // Bad.
</pre>

<p>The increment and decrement operators are actually a bit subtle. It turns out that you can do
  either</p>

<pre class="code">
  x++;
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="code">
  ++x;
</pre>

<p>if you want to increment <span class="code">x</span>. However, there is a difference. The
  difference shows up if you use <span class="code">++</span> (or <span
      class="code">--</span>) in a more complex expression. This is not something I want to get
  into right now. We will revisit the issue later when we are talking about pointers. But if you
  are interested, consider</p>

<pre class="code">
  x = y++;
  x = ++y;
</pre>

<p>In the first case the original value of <span class="code">y</span> is assigned to <span
    class="code">x</span> and then <span class="code">y</span> is incremented afterwards. In the
  second case, <span class="code">y</span> is incremented first and then the new value is assigned
  to <span class="code">x</span>. The first case is called "post" incrementing and the second case
  is called "pre" incrementing. If you didn't follow that, don't worry about. You don't need to
  understand that right now. For now, just avoid using <span
      class="code">++</span> or <span class="code">--</span> with any other operators.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">
  <li><p>In C you use '+' for addition, '-' for subtraction, '*' for multiplication, '/' for
    division, and '%' for modulus (remainder). For example:</p>

    <pre class="code">
  x = y / z;   // Computes y divided by z and puts result in x.
</pre>

    <p>When integers are divided the fractional result is thrown away. The result is an integer.
      For example, 5/2 is 2, not 2.5.</p></li>

  <li><p>C treats assignment as an operator. However, unlike most other operators, the <span
      class="code">=</span> operator modifies one of its operands (the left hand one).</p></li>

  <li><p>Large and complicated expressons can be made by combining operators so that the results
    of one calculation become an operand of the next. When combining operations, it is important
    to know which is done first. This depends on the precedence of the operators involved. You
    can, however, always use parentheses to force a certain order in the computation.</p></li>

  <li><p>C allows you to combine a simple math operation with an assignment using a shortcut
    operator. For example</p>

    <pre class="code">
  x += y;    // Like x = x + y;
</pre>

    <p>You can also increment (add one) or decrement (subtract one) a number using <span
        class="code">++</span> or <span class="code">--</span> like this</p>

    <pre class="code">
  x++;
  y--;
</pre>
  </li>
