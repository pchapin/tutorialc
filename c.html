<h2>General Links</h2>

<p>This page is a collection of C links that might be of interest to <a
    href="http://www.vtc.edu/">Vermont Technical College</a> students. Some of these links point
  at pages containing many other links. I've tried to bring the most useful links forward to this
  page, but there is a lot of information about C on the web and I certainly have not reviewed it
  all.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://pweb.netcom.com/~tjensen/ptr/pointers.htm">Tutorial on Pointers</a>. This
    is a nice work that focuses on what pointers are and how they should be used.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/">CProgramming.com</a>. This site has a wide
    selection of tutorials, quizzes, source code, and other materials designed to help people
    learn C. It also supports a message board where you can ask questions about C programming. I
    notice that in recent years this site seems to be focusing more and more on C++ and
    de-emphasizing "plain" C.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiler Specific Information</h2>

<p>If you want to program in C, you will need a compiler.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> is a free, open source compiler. It runs on most
    Unix systems and it has been ported to various non-Unix systems as well.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> is another free, open source C and C++
    compiler. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure.</p></li>

  <li><p>Microsoft's <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Microsoft Visual C/C++</a> is the
    defacto industry standard for C/C++ programming on Windows.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2">Open Watcom</a>. This is the open
    source version of an older, commercial compiler.</p></li>
</ul>
