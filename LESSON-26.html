<h2>Body</h2>
<h3>What is a structure?</h3>
<p>Except for the slight digression about file I/O the last several lessons have really all been
  about arrays. It is true that a lot of what we've covered has been about pointers, but in C
  arrays and pointers are very closely related. We are now ready to talk about the other major way
  that you can group related data items: structures.</p>
<p>Let me first review the essential aspects of an array.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All the items in an array have the same type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the array has a name, each item by itself does not. Instead you access the array's
      items using an integer index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The items are called "elements."</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A structure is basically the opposite of this.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The items in a structure can have different types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each item in a structure has its own name that you can use to refer to that item.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The items are called "members."</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Before you can use any structures in your program you need to tell the compiler what they are
  going to contain. The "definition" of a structure tells the compiler what that structure's
  members are going to be and assigns a name to the structure overall. Once the compiler has seen
  the definition of a particular type of structure you can then start creating variables of that
  structure type. Here is an example</p>
<pre class="code">
/* This structure type holds together all the interesting bits of
   information about a customer account. */
struct account_information {
  char last_name[32];        // The customer's last name as a string.
  char first_name[32];       // The customer's first name as a string.
  int  account_number;       // A unique account number.
  int  account_balance;      // The account balance in cents.
  int  preferred_customer;   // =1 if this is a preferred customer.
};

void f(void)
{
  // Declare a variable of type "struct account_information".
  struct account_information my_account;

  // Give that variable a value.
  strcpy(my_account.last_name, "Chapin");
  strcpy(my_account.first_name, "Peter");
  my_account.account_number     = 12345678;
  my_account.account_balance    = 0;
  my_account.preferred_customer = 1;

  ...
</pre>
<p>The definition of structure <span class="code">account_information</span> is first. When the
  compiler sees that definition it merely takes note of the details. No memory is allocated
  because there are no <span class="code">account_information</span> variables created (yet). My
  example structure is intended to contain all the information pertaining to a customer account.
  Each member is like a field of a database.</p>
<p>Notice that the members of <span class="code">account_information</span> each have their own
  name. Notice also how they can be of different types. In fact, members can even be arrays. You
  can put any type of variable into a structure: even other structures. This makes it possible to
  define rather complicated variables that can hold large quantities of data in a well organized
  manner. The whole point of structures is to make it easy for you to keep related data in one
  place. Your program will be much easier to understand if all pieces of information that go
  together are, in fact, "under the same roof".</p>
<p>In function <span class="code">f</span> I create a variable of type <span class="code"
>struct account_information</span>. Each time you define a structure you are effectively
  introducing a new type into the language. Just as you can declare variables of type <span
      class="code">int</span> or <span class="code">double</span>, you can also declare variables
  to be of any structure type that has been defined. The variable <span
      class="code">my_account</span> actually contains its own copy of the structure members. If I
  had declared other variables of type <span class="code">struct
        account_information</span> they would have had independent copies of the members. In other
  words, the <span class="code">first_name</span> member of <span class="code"
  >my_account</span> could hold a different value than the <span class="code"
  >first_name</span> member of some other <span class="code">struct
        account_information</span>.</p>
<p>After I declare <span class="code">my_account</span> I then wrote some statements that put
  values into <span class="code">my_account</span>'s members. Notice how I use a dot ('.') to
  separate the name of the structure variable from the name of the member. The combined name
  refers to that particular member of that particular structure variable. For example <span
      class="code">my_account.account_balance</span> represents the value of the <span
      class="code">account_balance</span> member of the <span class="code"
  >my_account</span> variable. It is an integer. The '.' operator is often called the "member
  selection operator". Notice that when you use the '.' operator you must provide it with the name
  of a structure variable on the left. Do not provide it with the name of a structure type! The
  following is illegal:</p>
<pre class="code">
account_information.account_balance = 1;
</pre>
<p>It doesn't make sense. Just where is that value of 1 being put? There is no variable named
  <span class="code">account_information</span>. That is the name of a structure type. The
  statement above would be similar to something like <span class="code">int = 1</span> and
  hopefully you can see right away the problem with that.</p>
<p>In my example above, <span class="code">last_name</span> and <span class="code"
>first_name</span> are names of arrays. Thus the expression <span class="code"
>my_account.last_name</span> is the name of an array without an index. The compiler regards this,
  as usual, as a pointer to the first element of the array. The fact that this array happens to be
  a member of the <span class="code">my_account</span> variable does not change that. Thus the
  statement</p>
<pre class="code">
strcpy(my_account.last_name, "Chapin");
</pre>
<p>is perfectly reasonable. It copies the literal string "Chapin" into the <span
    class="code">last_name</span> array that is a member of the <span class="code"
>my_account</span> variable.</p>
<h3>Structure memory layout</h3>
<p>It might be helpful in your understanding of structures to know something about how the
  compiler organizes them in memory. Below is a diagram showing how the <span class="code"
  >my_account</span> variable might be layed out. Keep in mind that the precise sizes of the
  members depends on the system you are using, but the sizes I indicate below are typical.</p>
<pre class="figure">

 0      |     | Start of the last_name array of characters

</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">my_account</span> variable requires 76 bytes of memory. The first 32
  bytes are set aside for the <span class="code">last_name</span> array. The next 32 bytes are set
  aside for the <span class="code">first_name</span> array. The next twelve bytes are set aside
  for the three integers <span class="code">account_number</span>, <span
      class="code">account_balance</span>, and <span class="code">perferred_customer</span>. To
  make things clearer I put the offset into the structure down the side of the picture. Although I
  don't know the actual memory address that will be used for <span class="code"
  >my_account</span>, I can say that the <span class="code">first_name</span> array, for example,
  will be at an address 32 bytes past the address of the beginning of the structure.</p>
<p>Actually, it is not always clear how the compiler will lay out your structures. The ANSI C
  standard does require certain things. The first member will definitely be at offset zero. The
  members will be layed out in the same order in which you declare them. However, the compiler is
  allowed to put "holes" in your structure if it wants. It might do this to cause certain members
  to line up at certain offsets. Some processors can access data faster if it is aligned in this
  manner.</p>
<p>For most applications you don't really need to worry about structure layout. I'm presenting it
  here mostly just to give you a better idea of what a structure is. Remember: every variable of a
  structure type has its own copy of the members. If I declared another variable of type <span
      class="code">struct account_information</span>, that other variable would also take 76 bytes
  and have its own memory areas for <span class="code"
  >last_name</span>, <span class="code">first_name</span>, and so forth.</p>
<h3>Structures are "first class" variables</h3>
<p>Arrays don't really exist in the C language. You can't compare two arrays with the <span
    class="code">==</span> operator and you can't assign one array to another with the assignment
  operator. However, structures do exist.</p>
<pre class="code">
struct account_information first, second;
  // Declare two account_information structures.

...

first = second;
  // Copy all the members of second into first.
</pre>
<p>You can assign one structure to another and it does what you would expect. It copies all the
  members of the source structure into the corresponding members of the destination structure.
  Notice that in this case <span class="code">struct account_information</span> contains arrays as
  two of its members. This does not cause a problem. The arrays are copied along with all the
  other members as desired. Thus even though you can't do <span
      class="code">first.last_name = second.last_name</span> to copy the <span class="code"
  >last_name</span> member only (you would have to use <span class="code">strcpy</span>), you can
  use the assignment operator to copy the entire structure just fine.</p>
<p>You might also think that you can use the <span class="code">==</span> operator to compare two
  structures.</p>
<pre class="code">
if (first == second) {
  // The two account informations are the same.
}
</pre>
<p>However, that doesn't work. You might guess that such an operation would be true only if all
  the members are the same. However, the compiler doesn't assume that meaning. Instead attempts to
  compare structures with the usual comparison operators are errors. If you want to do something
  like this, you would have to write a function.</p>
<p>I will say more about how structures work with functions in the next lesson.</p>
<h3>More accessing information</h3>
<p>Since structures can contain arrays you might be wondering how you would refer to a single
  element of a member array. Here is an example.</p>
<pre class="code">
struct account_information my_account;

...

if (my_account.first_name[0] == 'P') { ... }
</pre>
<p>The expression <span class="code">my_account.first_name[0]</span> refers to the zeroth
  character of the <span class="code">first_name</span> array inside the <span class="code"
  >my_account</span> variable. To understand why this is the correct interpretation, consult an
  operator precedence chart. Notice that structure member reference and array element reference
  have the same precedence. Notice also that they associate from left to right. Thus without any
  additional parentheses the expression becomes</p>
<pre class="code">
(my_account.first_name)[0]
</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">first_name member</span> of <span class="code">my_account</span> is
  accessed and then the array reference is made. This is just what you would want. My point here
  is that structure access can be analyzed using the same rules as any other operation. Let's take
  a look at another example.</p>
<pre class="code">
struct time {
  int seconds;
  int minutes;
  int hours;
};

struct example {
  char *p;
  struct time now;
};

struct example var;
</pre>
<p>This example first defines a <span class="code">struct time</span> that holds the data required
  to represent time as three integer members. It next defines a silly structure <span
      class="code">example</span> that contains a pointer, and a variable of type <span
      class="code">struct time</span>. Finally it creates a variable of type <span
      class="code">struct example</span> named <span class="code">var</span>. Now consider the
  following statements.</p>
<pre class="code">
*var.p = 'x';
</pre>
<p>This is legal. The structure selection operator has higher precedence than the indirection
  operator. As a result the above is really</p>
<pre class="code">
*(var.p) = 'x';
</pre>
<p>Since the <span class="code">p</span> member of <span class="code">var</span> is a pointer, it
  makes sense to apply the indirection operator to that pointer. This statement stores the
  character 'x' into the memory location pointed at by the <span class="code"
  >p</span> member of <span class="code">var</span>. I certainly hope that pointer has been given
  a meaningful value first!</p>
<p>This is also legal.</p>
<pre class="code">
if (var.now.seconds == 0) { ... }
</pre>
<p>The structure selection operator associates from left to right so the above is really</p>
<pre class="code">
if ((var.now).seconds == 0) { ... }
</pre>
<p>But <span class="code">var.now</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">struct
        time</span>. Thus it makes sense to access the <span class="code">seconds</span> member of
  that variable. Since the <span class="code">seconds</span> member is an integer, it makes sense
  to compare it to zero.</p>
<h3>Initializing structures.</h3>
<p>Just as you can initialize a integer variable or an array when you declare it, you can also
  initialize a structure. The syntax is very similar to the array initialization syntax. Here is
  an example using <span class="code">struct account_information</span> again.</p>
<pre class="code">
struct account_information my_account = {
  "Chapin", "Peter", 12345678, 0, 1
};
</pre>
<p>As with arrays, the initializers for the members go between braces. The difference is that with
  a structure each initializer is potentially of a different type. Notice that the initializers
  must come in the same order as that in which the members were declared. This example initializes
  <span class="code">my_account</span> to the same values that were put into <span class="code">my_account</span>
  in my very first example. Notice also that I'm using the special method of initializing
  character arrays here. I'm using a string literal to intialize the <span
      class="code">last_name</span> and <span class="code"
  >first_name</span> members. This prevents me from having to write</p>
<pre class="code">
struct account_information my_account = {
  { 'C', 'h', 'a', 'p', 'i', 'n', '\0' },
  { 'P', 'e', 't', 'e', 'r', '\0' },
  12345678, 0, 1
};
</pre>
<p>However, the above is also legal. You can initilize a member array by using a brace enclosed
  list nested inside the braces used to initialize the structure itself. You can use the same
  method to initialize a member that is also a structure.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>A structure variable contains many other variables, called members, inside of it. The
      members each have their own name and type. To use structures, you first have to provide the
      compiler with a structure definition. Then you can declare variables to be of that structure
      type. Each structure variable you declare has its own independent copy of the members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You access the members of a structure using the '.' operator. To the left of the dot you
      put the name of the structure variable. To the right of the dot you put the name of the
      member inside the structure variable that you wish to access. If the member is an array or
      another structure you can apply the <span class="code">[]</span> operator or the '.'
      operator to that member as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Structures can be initialized using a brace enclosed list of initializers very much like
      the way arrays are initialized.</p>
  </li>
