<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The documents linked to this page constitute the "lectures" of a one-semester, introductory
  course in the C programming language. I created these documents myself and have used them in
  programming classes at <a href="http://www.vtc.edu/">Vermont Technical College</a>, where I am
  an instructor. I am posting these documents on the web for public access under the terms of the
  <a href="GFDL.txt">GNU Free Documentation License</a> (GFDL).</p>

<h2>Lessons</h2>

<p>This course covers all the major features of the C language: variables, types, expressions,
  control flow, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, and structures. In addition, I cover a
  number of other, minor topics. I have broken all of this material into 30 lessons along with
  some supporting files. Each lesson builds on the previous lessons. I recommend that you read the
  lessons in order. However, if you have some previous C experience, you may find it useful to
  skip around. The first three lessons are designed to get you on board using a Unix system where
  I assume you will be writing your programs. If you plan to work on a different operating system
  or if you are familiar with Unix, you may be able to skip those lessons. The C related content
  starts with Lesson #4.</p>

<p>When I last taught this course, the text associated with it was Stephen G. Kochan's
  "Programming in ANSI C" (Revised edition, Sams Publishing, (C) 1994, ISBN=0-672-30339-6). You
  could use any reasonable book on C to supplement this material. However, I have prepared <a
      href="text-reading.txt">specific reading assignments</a> from Kochan's text to support each
  of the lessons.</p>

<p>In addition to the lessons themselves, I have also prepared some sample programs to help
  illustrate some points and to show the features of C in a larger context than is possible in the
  lessons. In the list below, I show links to these samples as well as to the lesson text. Each
  sample is associated with a particular lesson. You should review each sample after you've read
  the corresponding lesson text.</p>

<p>Other C features that I may write about at a later time include: enums, unions, bit fields,
  internationalization (i18n), and changes introduced in C99 (relative to C89/90). In addition, I
  would like to create a few more examples or perhaps elaborate a bit on some of the existing
  examples.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>The links below are of general interest.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have a page of links to other <a href="c.html">C related materials on the web</a> (sketchy
    at this time).
  </li>

  <li>Although I run this course on a Unix system, you might prefer to do your program development
    on a Windows system instead. There are several <a
        href="free-compilers.html">free compilers</a> that you can download and install to make
    that possible.
  </li>

  <li>At various places in my lessons, I refer to the <a href="../c-style.html">VTC Style Guide
    for C/C++ Programming</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Although most of the material above is non-operating system specific, I do encourage my
    students to explore the curses terminal handling library&mdash;something that is usually seen
    as particular to Unix. I believe that curses is an interesting example of a third party
    library as well as just plain fun to explore. Accordingly, I have written a <a
        href="curses.txt">short document to help students get up to speed with curses</a>.
  </li>

  <li>I have also posted materials for a one-semester course in C++ and object-oriented
    programming. The prerequisite for that course is the successful completion of this course in
    C. When you are finished reading over the lessons in this course, I invite you to continue
    your study with my <a href="../TutorialCpp">C++ tutorial</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
