<h2>Body</h2>
<h3>What is the preprocessor?</h3>
<p>I have completed talking about all the major features of C. In particular: variables and types,
  flow of control (loops, if statements, etc), functions, arrays, pointers, and structures. These
  are features that you will also find in many (most?) other programming languages. To complete
  this course I need to talk about a few additional topics. Some of these topics are very specific
  to C. Some of them are required by other courses at VTC which hold this course as a
  prerequisite. The final three lessons will just be a collection of largely unrelated things to
  fill in some important holes.</p>
<p>The first of these topics will be on the C preprocessor. Although somewhat unique to C, you
  can't be an effective C programmer without at least some knowledge of the preprocessor. I will
  spend this entire lesson talking about it.</p>
<p>The preprocessor is, conceptually, a program that processes your source code before the
  compiler sees it. The preprocessor is not the C compiler. Its rules are different than those
  used by the compiler. Furthermore you could use the C preprocessor on other files besides C
  source code. (I understand that some assembly language programmers are fond of using the C
  preprocessor on their programs).</p>
<p>The preprocessor looks for special "preprocessor directives" in your source code. It carries
  out the commands specified by those directives, editing your source code in the process. The
  resulting edited file (without the preprocessor directives) is what the compiler actually sees.
  Keep in mind, however, that although I talk about the preprocessor editing your file, the
  changes that it makes are not (normally) saved to disk. Instead the edited version of your
  program is passed directly to the compiler through memory.</p>
<p>Preprocessor directives all begin with a '#' character and run to the end of the line. They are
  not terminated with a semicolon and they do not (normally) continue to the next line. There are
  several preprocessor directives, but the most common are <span
      class="code">#include</span>, <span class="code">#define</span>, and <span class="code"
  >#if</span>.</p>
<h3>#include</h3>
<p>You have, of course, already seen this directive in action. Here is an example</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Technically the first line (with the <span class="code">#include</span>) is not legal C. If you
  were to let a C compiler process that line, you would get an error. However, all C compilers
  come with a preprocessor and they all arrange to have that preprocessor execute first. When the
  preprocessor sees the <span class="code">#include</span> it searches for the file named by the
  include. It then removes the include and replaces it with the contents of the specified file. By
  the time the compiler sees your program the <span
      class="code">#include</span> is gone.</p>
<p>The preprocessor couldn't care less about what is in the included file. I could split my
  "Hello, World" program into several files and paste them all together with <span
      class="code">#include</span>s. For example if "first.txt" contained</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(
</pre>
<p>and "second.txt" contained</p>
<pre class="code">
void) {
</pre>
<p>and "third.txt" contained</p>
<pre class="code">
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>My hello.c could look like</p>
<pre class="code">
#include "first.txt"
#include "second.txt"
#include "third.txt"
</pre>
<p>and it would compile just fine. Notice how first.txt contains a <span class="code"
>#include</span> of it's own. This is fine. The preprocessor scans over the included text looking
  for other preprocessing directives. It will do this as deeply as necessary.</p>
<p>Just because you can put anything you want into an included file doesn't mean you should. The
  preprocessor can be abused. Traditionally included files end with a .h extension and contain
  only declarations that need to be shared between .c files. You should avoid <span
      class="code">#includ</span>ing function definitions, files other than .h files, or putting
  <span class="code">#include</span> directives anywhere other than at the top of your .c file.
  The preprocessor allows other things, but taking advantage of that will cause your program to be
  very confusing.</p>
<h3>#define</h3>
<p>The <span class="code">#define</span> directive allows you to create a symbolic name. There are
  two sorts of such names. The first is called an "object-like macro" and the second is called a
  "function-like macro".</p>
<p>Here is what a typical object-like macro looks like</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXSIZE 1024
</pre>
<p>There are three parts. The first part is the <span class="code">#define</span> directive
  itself. The second part is the symbolic name (<span class="code">MAXSIZE</span>). The third part
  is what the symbolic name represents (<span class="code">1024</span>). After seeing this
  definition, the preprocessor will replace every occurrence of <span
      class="code">MAXSIZE</span> that it finds with <span class="code">1024</span>. It does a
  simple search and replace operation on your file. Nothing more. Thus</p>
<pre class="code">
int main(void)
{
  int array[MAXSIZE];   // I really said "array[1024]"
  int i;


  for (i = 0; i &lt; MAXSIZE; i++) { // I really said "i &lt; 1024"
    // etc...
</pre>
<p>Why would I want to do this? Well, for one thing <span class="code">MAXSIZE</span> is more
  informational than 1024. It makes the program easier to read. However, the big advantage is when
  I try to update this program. Even in my short example above, I'm using <span class="code">MAXSIZE</span>
  in two different places. In a large program I might use it in dozens of places (often as the
  limit in a for loop). When I later decide that 1024 isn't big enough, all I have to do is edit
  the <span class="code">#define</span> directive where <span class="code">MAXSIZE</span> is
  defined. I might change it to</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXSIZE 2048
</pre>
<p>and then recompile. The preprocessor will replace all occurrences of <span class="code"
>MAXSIZE</span> with the new value and I will have updated the program by making only one change.
  This is a major advantage. The alternative would be to search around for all occurances of 1024
  and try to replace them with 2048. The problem with that is some 1024's might refer to something
  else and not really need to be replaced. Thus I'm faced with the prospect of locating every 1024
  in the program and then figuring out if that 1024 is one that needs updating. Ugh. But it's even
  worse than that! There might be some other numbers, such as some 1023s that also need to be
  updated. With the preprocessor, this is not a big deal</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXLINEBUFFERSIZE 1024
#define MAXCOLORDEPTH     1024
#define MAXSCREENBUFFER   1024
#define MAXUSERLIMIT      1024
</pre>
<p>In the program I use <span class="code">MAXUSERLIMIT</span> everywhere it is appropriate to do
  so. In some cases I might have to write things like <span class="code">MAXUSERLIMIT
        - 1</span> (instead of 1023) or <span class="code">MAXUSERLIMIT/2</span> (instead of 512).
  However, if I do this properly things are easy afterward. Now when I decide that the user limit
  size needs to be extended I just do</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXLINEBUFFERSIZE 1024
#define MAXCOLORDEPTH     1024
#define MAXSCREENBUFFER   1024
#define MAXUSERLIMIT      2048
</pre>
<p>and recompile. Many programs have a large number of object-like macros contained in a "master"
  header file that gets <span class="code">#include</span>d into every source file of the program.
  Often you can customize the program by editing the values of those macros (and they are often
  heavily commented to make this feasible) and recompiling.</p>
<p>It is very important when you define an object-like macro to use it consistently. If you forget
  to use it in even one place the advantage of having it is lost.</p>
<p>Notice how I use all uppercase letters for my symbolic names. This is not technically required.
  The preprocessor, like C, is case sensitive. If you do choose to use lower case names, you must
  do so consistently. However, the tradition is to use uppercase names. In fact the VTC style
  guide requires it.</p>
<p>The name you use for an object-like macro must follow the same rules as other names you choose
  in your C program. In particular, it can only contain letters, digits, and the underscore
  character. It can't start with a digit. However the "expansion text" can contain anything. It
  need not be just a number. For example</p>
<pre class="code">
#define   INFINITE_LOOP   while (1)
</pre>
<p>Now in your program you could write</p>
<pre class="code">
INFINITE_LOOP {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
</pre>
<p>to create an infinite loop. The preprocessor will simply replace the word <span
    class="code">INFINITE_LOOP</span> with <span class="code">while (1)</span> and give you</p>
<pre class="code">
while (1) {
  printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
</pre>
<p>This is legal C and will be accepted by the compiler without complaint. People sometimes get
  carried away with this feature. For example if you do</p>
<pre class="code">
#define BEGIN  {
#define END    }
#define AND    &amp;&amp;
#define OR     ||
</pre>
<p>you can write</p>
<pre class="code">
if (x == y AND x &lt; z)
  BEGIN
    printf("x has the right value now!\n");
  END
</pre>
<p>and it will compile fine. Keep in mind that C programmers take a dim view of this technique.
  The usual response is, "If you want to program in Pascal, get a Pascal compiler!" Nevertheless,
  using macros to simplify tedious typing can be useful. Suppose you needed to write many loops
  that ran <span class="code">i</span> over the range 0 to <span class="code">MAXSIZE</span>. You
  could do this</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXSIZE 1024  // For now. Might upgrade later.
#define SCAN_ARRAY for (i = 0; i &lt; MAXSIZE; i++)
</pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre class="code">
SCAN_ARRAY {
  printf("array[i] = %d\n", array[i]);
}
</pre>
<p>If you need to write such loops 20 or 30 times you might prefer to type <span
    class="code">SCAN_ARRAY</span> over typing out the loop header (and risking a typo) each of
  those times. Notice in this example I'm using an object-like macro in the expansion text of
  another object-like macro. This works fine. After substituting expansion text for a macro, the
  preprocessor will rescan that text looking for other macros to expand.</p>
<p>Function-like macros also involve replacing a symbolic name with expansion text. However,
  unlike object-like macros, they take parameters. Here is how it might look.</p>
<pre class="code">
#define SQUARE(x) x * x
</pre>
<p>Here the macro <span class="code">SQUARE</span> takes a parameter that I'm calling <span
    class="code">x</span>. When it expands the macro the expansion text is computed by copying the
  macro's parameter into every place <span class="code">x</span> appears in the expansion text
  above. For example</p>
<pre class="code">
int i;

printf("i squared is %d.\n", SQUARE(i));
</pre>
<p>would become</p>
<pre class="code">
printf("i squared is %d.\n", i * i);
</pre>
<p>It is very important when you define a function-like macro that you don't put a space after the
  macro's name and before the parenthesis. If you do</p>
<pre class="code">
#define SQUARE (x) x * x
</pre>
<p>The preprocessor will think you defined an object-like macro with the expansion text of <span
    class="code">(x) x * x</span>. In that case</p>
<pre class="code">
printf("i squared is %d.\n", SQUARE(i));
</pre>
<p>would become</p>
<pre class="code">
printf("i squared is %d.\n", (x) x * x(i));
</pre>
<p>which is a big, bad syntax error. This is one of the problems with using macros. The error
  messages you get are produced by the compiler <em>after</em> the preprocessor has edited your
  file. Sometimes they don't make sense when compared with the original source code. The syntax of
  the original <span class="code">printf</span>, with the <span
      class="code">SQUARE</span> macro present, looks perfectly fine.</p>
<p>There are other problems with function-like macros. Let me take my <span class="code"
>SQUARE</span> example. Suppose I try this</p>
<pre class="code">
x = y / SQUARE(z - 1);
</pre>
<p>Here I think I'm dividing y by the square of z - 1. But look again</p>
<pre class="code">
x = y / z - 1 * z - 1;
</pre>
<p>This is what the compiler actually sees (yes... the macro parameter can be any text you want).
  The precedence rules of C cause this to be handled like so</p>
<pre class="code">
x = (y / z) - (1 * z) - 1;
</pre>
<p>which is a totally different calculation. To avoid this you can define the SQUARE macro with
  lots of extra parentheses.</p>
<pre class="code">
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))
</pre>
<p>Then my expression expands to</p>
<pre class="code">
x = y / ((z - 1) * (z - 1));
</pre>
<p>This works, but the need to do things like this is a hazard. With real functions the matter
  doesn't come up so people tend to forget about it when writing function-like macros.</p>
<p>Another hazard has to do with the fact that my <span class="code">SQUARE</span> macro evaluates
  its argument more than once. Check this out</p>
<pre class="code">
x = SQUARE(y++);
</pre>
<p>Here I think I'm squaring <span class="code">y</span> and putting the result into <span
    class="code">x</span> and then incrementing <span class="code">y</span> afterwards
  (post-increment). But look again</p>
<pre class="code">
x = ((y++) * (y++));
</pre>
<p>Actually <span class="code">y</span> is incremented twice. What's worse is that it's unclear
  what value is actually put into <span class="code">x</span>. It will depend on just how the
  compiler decides to compute the expression. When is the multiplication done relative to the
  incrementing? Again real functions don't have this problem and are thus safer to use.</p>
<p>This probably leads you to wonder why bother with function-like macros at all? There are two
  reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A function-like macro can expand into any text. You can write a function-like macro with
      expansion text containing keywords. You can't do that with a function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calling a function takes some time. For very simple calculations a function-like macro
      might be faster. Often the difference in performance doesn't matter. Sometimes it matters a
      great deal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In fact several "functions" in the C standard library are really function-like macros because
  of reason #2 above. One that you've used quite a bit in this course is <span
      class="code">getchar</span>. Although the standard does not require <span class="code"
  >getchar</span> to be a function-like macro it often is for performance reasons. Notice that
  <span class="code">getchar</span> seems to violate the tradition of using uppercase letters for
  macro names. The standard library can get away with that.</p>
<h3>#if</h3>
<p>The <span class="code">#if</span> directive is called a "conditional compilation directive".
  You can use it to cause the compiler to ignore certain parts of your program depending on the
  value of other macros. Here is one way to use it.</p>
<pre class="code">
for (i = 0; i &lt; MAXSIZE; i++) {
  #if DEBUG == 1
    printf("Processing loop pass #%d\n", i);
  #endif

  ...
}
</pre>
<p>Suppose that some place higher up in your program you had</p>
<pre class="code">
#define DEBUG 0  // Make into 1 to turn on debugging output.
</pre>
<p>When the preprocessor examines your file it will see that <span class="code">DEBUG ==
        1</span> is false. Thus it will remove the material between the <span class="code"
>#if</span> and the <span class="code">#endif</span>. As a result the compiler will never know
  that you wrote a <span class="code">printf</span> there. However, if you edit the definition of
  <span class="code">DEBUG</span> so that it reads</p>
<pre class="code">
#define DEBUG 1
</pre>
<p>and recompile your program the preprocessor will this time include the <span class="code"
>printf</span> statement. In this way you can leave your debugging <span class="code"
>printf</span>s in your source code and selectively turn them off and on by changing the
  definition of a macro and recompiling.</p>
<p>Doing conditional compliation like this is very common. In fact, many programs have many
  complex <span class="code">#if... #else... #endif</span> blocks that select special code for one
  operating system or another or for one processor or another. That way a single source file can
  be used on many different systems with appropriate sections conditionally compiled into place.
  Take a look at /usr/include/curses.h for an example that is all too typical.</p>
<p>Most compilers have a facility that allows you to define a symbol on the command line as if you
  had written a <span class="code">#define</span> in the source file. For example, with cc you can
  do</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -DDEBUG -o hello hello.c</span>
</pre>
<p>The -D option turns on the specified symbol, in this case <span class="code"
>DEBUG</span>, so that it has the expansion text of "1". Assuming there were conditional
  compliation directives in hello.c that were sensitive to the <span class="code"
  >DEBUG</span> symbol this command would produce an appropriately specialized executable.</p>
<p>I won't say much more about how conditional compilation works right now. However, if you ever
  do find yourself working with a large program&mdash;especially one that was written to work on
  many systems&mdash;you will see conditional compilation being used extensively.</p>
<h3>The problem with the preprocessor</h3>
<p>At this point you might be thinking that the preprocessor is a pretty neat feature. In fact, it
  can be used in very powerful ways. Most C programs use the preprocessor extensively. However, it
  has some problems as well, and it is falling out of favor. C++ introduces a number of features
  specifically to make using the preprocessor less necessary. In the future the preprocessor will
  probably be dropped out of C++ entirely and most instructors of C++ encourage people to stay
  away from the preprocessor if at all possible.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>The main problem with the preprocessor is that it has no notion of scope. It does not
  understand C and it does not know about nested declarations or variable hiding. Here is a simple
  example to illustrate.</p>
<pre class="code">
#define MAXSIZE 1024

...


void f(void)
{
  int MAXSIZE = 16;

  ...
</pre>
<p>The person who wrote function <span class="code">f</span> created a local variable named <span
    class="code">MAXSIZE</span>. Because that variable is local that programmer probably felt that
  he/she could name it without any concerns of conflict. The existence of a local variable of that
  name in another function or even a global variable of that name would not affect function <span
      class="code">f</span> at all.</p>
<p>Alas, it turns out that there is a <span class="code">#define</span> of <span
    class="code">MAXSIZE</span> in effect. Probably that <span class="code">#define</span> is
  sitting in a library header file; the programmer who wrote function <span class="code"
  >f</span> is not even aware that it exists. If that <span class="code">MAXSIZE</span> had been a
  global variable it wouldn't have mattered. But because the preprocessor just does a simple
  search and replace, function <span class="code">f</span> becomes</p>
<pre class="code">
void f(void)
{
  int 1024 = 16;
</pre>
<p>This is a syntax error. The programmer who wrote <span class="code">f</span> is going to get a
  strange error message about his/her declaration of <span class="code"
  >MAXSIZE</span>. In a large program this issue is a major problem. Large programs typically have
  hundreds of <span class="code">#define</span>d names spread over dozens of header files. There
  is no way a single programmer is going to know them all. Yet the preprocessor is reaching into
  every function and every block editing those functions in unexpected ways. It's nice when the
  preprocessor edits the function so that there is a compile error. That way, at least, you can
  fix the problem. Now imagine that the change is such that the program still compiles! A bug
  might exist in code that looks perfectly correct because the preprocessor has modified that code
  in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>This is very bad.</p>
<p>The compiler knows about variable scope and can let one declaration hide another. Thus the
  current trend is to avoid using the preprocessor and use language features instead. This is one
  reason why I put this lesson at the very end of the course. You need to know about the
  preprocessor if you are to work with C. The C language requires the preprocessor to do certain
  things because it lacks the necessary features to do without it. However, you should avoid using
  it when you can. Other languages don't have a preprocessor at all, and they are not likely to
  get one.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>You can use the <span class="code">#include</span> directive to merge a file into the file
      you are compiling. It is most often used to cause the compiler to read over declarations of
      functions and global entities (such as global variables and structure definitions) that are
      to be shared between several source files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can use <span class="code">#define</span> to create a symbolic name for a constant.
      Doing this makes it easier to update your program when you want to change the value of the
      constant. Just change the <span class="code">#define</span> and let the preprocessor change
      everywhere else that it is used.</p>
    <p>You can also use <span class="code">#define</span> to create a macro with parameters. This
      allows more flexibility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="code">#if</span> directive can be used to cause the compiler to skip over
      sections of your program depending on the value of other macros. This allows you to
      specialize your program in different ways so that it will work properly on different
      systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preprocessor is a powerful tool, but it doesn't really understand C and it knows
      nothing about scope. Macros can potentially modify code inside nested blocks where the
      programmer feels safe from such things. In a large program with many included header files,
      there are more macros active than a programmer typically knows about. The preprocessor can
      thus introduce mysterious errors and subtle bugs. For this reason the preprocessor is
      falling out of favor and many students of programming are advised to avoid it when
      possible.</p>
