<h1>Lesson #15</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Scope. Local (Block) vs Global</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lesson I will cover the following topics</p>
<ol id="overview-list">
  <li>
    <p>Local scope and global scope.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Variable hiding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why global variables should be avoided and how that can be accomplished.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Body</h2>
<h3>Local scope</h3>
<p>The topic of scope is important so read carefully!</p>
<p>So far in my examples I have declared variables just inside the opening brace of main. In the
  last lesson I showed how you can create and use other functions besides main. In those examples
  I declared some variables inside main and some inside the other function. I did this on purpose.
  To understand the significance of this, take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// The function named 'f' takes no parameters and returns nothing.
void f(void)
{
  int i;

  i = 5;
}

// The main function.
int main(void)
{
  int i;

  i = 2;
  printf("i = %d\n", i);
  f();
  printf("i = %d\n", i);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>As always, the program starts with <span class="code">main</span>. Inside <span
    class="code">main</span> a variable named <span class="code">i</span> is declared and the
  value 2 is assigned to it. The first <span class="code">printf</span> prints</p>
<pre class="terminal">
i = 2
</pre>
<p>Next, the function <span class="code">f</span> is called. Inside <span class="code"
>f</span> another variable named <span class="code">i</span> is declared and the value 5 is
  assigned to it. Nothing more is done inside <span class="code">f</span> (making it a rather
  strange function) so <span class="code">f</span> returns back to <span class="code"
  >main</span>. What does the second <span class="code">printf</span> display? The answer is</p>
<pre class="terminal">
i = 2
</pre>
<p>just like before. This is because the <span class="code">i</span> inside function <span
    class="code">f</span> has nothing to do with the <span class="code">i</span> inside <span
    class="code">main</span>. They are two different variables entirely. The main function does
  not know about the <span class="code">i</span> inside function <span
      class="code">f</span>. When you talk about <span class="code">i</span> in <span
      class="code">main</span> you are talking only about <span class="code">main</span>'s <span
      class="code">i</span>. As far as <span class="code">main</span> is concerned the variables
  inside <span class="code">f</span> don't exist.</p>
<p>You might think that perhaps this works because <span class="code">f</span> has its own
  declaration of <span class="code">i</span>. Perhaps in the following example things are
  different:</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// The function named 'f' takes no parameters and returns nothing.
void f(void)
{
  i = 5;
}

// The main function.
int main(void)
{
  int i;

  i = 2;
  printf("i = %d\n", i);
  f();
  printf("i = %d\n", i);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The only difference here is that <span class="code">f</span> no longer tries to declare <span
    class="code">i</span>. Instead it just assigns the value of 5 to <span
    class="code">i</span>. Which <span class="code">i</span> is it using? The one in <span
    class="code">main</span>? No. This program is in error and it won't even compile. When the
  compiler sees me trying to assign to <span class="code">i</span> in function <span
      class="code">f</span> it will complain by saying that <span class="code">i</span> is an
  "undefined identifier". In other words, there is no declaration for that <span
      class="code">i</span> and the compiler doesn't know what it is. The compiler will not assume
  that it has anything to do with the <span class="code">i</span> in <span
      class="code">main</span>.</p>
<p><em>Remember:</em> Variables declared inside a function are said to be "local" to that function
  and are said to have "local scope". They do not exist outside of the function.</p>
<p>This rule is <em>very</em> important. It means that you can use functions correctly without
  knowing what variables those functions use. Take a look at this program.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // Get the user's age.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Now print it out.
  printf("I understand you to be %d years old.\n", age);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Now suppose that, for some reason, the <span class="code">printf</span> function used a
  variable named <span class="code">age</span> internally (keep in mind that <span
      class="code">printf</span> is probably also written in C). So what? It doesn't matter what
  variables <span class="code">printf</span> is trying to use or what it's trying to do with them.
  When I say <span class="code">age</span> I'm talking about the <span
      class="code">age</span> variable that I declared in my <span class="code">main</span>. Any
  <span class="code">age</span> variables declared inside any of the other functions I'm using are
  different and won't interfere.</p>
<p>Without this rule it would be next to impossible to write a large program. Because of this rule
  two things are true.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You don't need to worry about what local variables are being used by the functions you
      call. The variables you use are the ones you declare. You won't accidently use a variable
      that some other function is trying to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you write a function you can choose whatever variable names you like. You don't need
      to worry about accidently changing variables somewhere else in the program.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>When a program is created by many different people, the last thing you want to worry about is
  coordinating variable names. And... you don't have to. You can pick whatever names you like and
  the other people can pick whatever names they like. There will be no clashes as long as all your
  variables have local scope (declared inside functions).</p>
<h3>Global scope</h3>
<p>As you can probably guess there is an alternative to local scope. It is called global scope.
  Such variables can be accessed by every function in the program. Here is an example</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// Global variables are declared outside of all functions.
int i;

void f(void)
{
  // Here i is not "undefined." The value 5 is assigned to the global.
  i = 5;
}

int main(void)
{
  // Program starts by assigning 2 to the global.
  i = 2;
  printf("i = %d\n", i);  // Prints i = 2
  f();                    // Function f modifies the global.
  printf("i = %d\n", i);  // Prints i = 5

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This program is very much the same as my earlier example. However, in this case the assignment
  of 5 to <span class="code">i</span> in function <span class="code">f</span> is not an error. The
  compiler has seen the global declaration of <span class="code">i</span> and thus knows that the
  <span class="code">i</span> in function <span class="code"
  >f</span> is the global <span class="code">i</span>. When the program starts, it assigns 2 to
  the global <span class="code">i</span> and then prints</p>
<pre class="terminal">
i = 2
</pre>
<p>Next it calls function <span class="code">f</span> which changes the value stored in the global
  <span class="code">i</span>. When <span class="code">main</span> resumes the next <span
      class="code">printf</span> prints the new value</p>
<pre class="terminal">
i = 5
</pre>
<p>In my earlier examples there were two different local variables named <span class="code"
>i</span>. But there is only one global variable of any given name.</p>
<p>When you declare a variable outside of all functions it can be used inside any function that is
  defined after that variable's declaration. Typically people put global variable declarations at
  the top of their program so that every function in the program can use it. For example</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int i;  // This is where global variables are usually declared.

void f(void)
{
  i = 5;  // Fine. Changes the global i.
  j = 7;  // Error. What is j?
}

int j;  // This is also a "global" but it can only be used from here down.

void g(void)
{
  i = 5;  // Fine. Changes the global i.
  j = 7;  // Fine. Changes the global j.
}
</pre>
<h3>Mixing global and local variables</h3>
<p>You can have different local variables with the same name as long as they are in different
  functions. However, there can be only one global variable with a particular name. You might now
  wonder what happens when you try to create a local variable with the same name as a global
  variable. This example shows the effect</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int i;  // Global variable.

void f(void)
{
  i = 5;  // Sets the global i to 5.
}

int main(void)
{
  int i;  // Fine. Local variable named i is different than the global.

  i = 2;                  // Sets the local i to 2.
  printf("i = %d\n", i);  // Prints i = 2
  f();                    // Function f changes the global i.
  printf("i = %d\n", i);  // Prints i = 2

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Inside function <span class="code">main</span> any use of the name <span class="code"
>i</span> refers to the local variable. The global variable is "hidden" by the local and, in
  effect, does not exist. However, in other functions without any local <span
      class="code">i</span>, using the name <span class="code">i</span> refers to the global
  variable. This is exactly what you want. When you declare a local variable and use it, you don't
  have to worry about similarly named local variables in other functions OR global variables. This
  gives you control over what you are doing. When you create and use a local variable you are
  getting exactly what you expect.</p>
<p>Actually you can declare variables inside any block. Such variables are local to that block and
  hide any similarly named variables outside of that block. This is not often done in C (it is
  more common in C++) but here is how it looks.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int i = 2; // Declare a global variable and initialize it to 2.

int main(void)
{
  int i;   // Local declaration hides the global variable.

  // Loop ten times. The value of the global i is not changed by this.
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    int i = 5;  // Declare a new i local to this block and initialize it.

    printf("i = %d\n", i); // Prints i = 5 all the time.
  }

  // Print the value of the i declared in main (currently 10).
  printf("i = %d\n", i);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The global scope covers the entire program. Each block that you create with braces creates a
  new, inner scope into which you can optional declare variables. These inner declarations exist
  only in the block in which they are declared and they hide any similarly named variables
  declared in an enclosing block. Read this paragraph twice. This principle is very important.</p>
<p>It sometimes helps to turn things around a bit. When you use a variable the compiler needs to
  locate a declaration for that variable so that the compiler knows the type of the variable and
  so forth. The compiler starts its search in the innermost block where you used the variable. If
  it doesn't find a declaration there, it expands its search to the block enclosing the innermost
  block. The compiler continues in this way, expanding the search outwards block by block looking
  for a declaration. The compiler will even search outside all functions as a last ditch effort to
  locate the declaration. This final "block" is the global scope. If it can't locate a declaration
  for the variable even there, it gives up and calls the variable undefined.</p>
<h3>And the point is?</h3>
<p>Local variables have the very desirable property that they are not influenced by things
  happening in other parts of your program. Considering that most programs are written by large
  teams of people this is a very good thing. When you write a function you don't want to worry
  about the variables other people have created or will create.</p>
<p>However, there are times when two different functions want to share information. In that case,
  it is sometimes handy to have both of those functions manipulate a common global variable.
  Global variables definitely have their place. However, global variables "connect" two otherwise
  independent functions and thus make it more difficult to modify one of the functions without
  "breaking" the other. In general you should not use global variables! Global variables are
  useful only for certain, specialized situations. You should avoid them unless you absolutely
  know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Some students resort to using global variables when they should use function parameters
  instead. Let me show you a very simple example of that first. In the program below, I'm using a
  function to print out the result of a calculation. This is a bit silly, but I will show a more
  juicy example later.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int result;  // Global variable.

/*
 * This function takes no parameters and returns nothing. However it does
 * access the global variable Result.
 */
void print_result(void)
{
  printf("The result = %d\n", result);
}

int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // Ask the user for his/her age and store it in a local variable.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Compute age/2 (rounded up) and store in the global variable.
  result = (age + 1) / 2;

  // Call the function that prints the global variable.
  print_result();

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Here I'm using a global variable to transmit information from one function to another. This is
  totally unnecessary. Sending information from one function to another is exactly what function
  parameters are for. Here is a version that does without the global variable. It is better.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// This function takes the value to be printed as a parameter.
void print_result(int the_result)
{
  printf("The result = %d\n", the_result);
}

int main(void)
{
  int age;
  int result;

  // Ask the user for his/her age and store it in a local variable.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Compute age/2 (rounded up) and store in a local variable.
  result = (age + 1) / 2;

  // Call the function that prints the results.
  print_result(result);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Because this program has no global variables the functions in it are more independent. The
  <span class="code">print_result</span> function might be useful in another program. If so, you
  only need to copy and paste it from this program to the new one. Moving the <span
      class="code">print_result</span> function in the original version would be harder. The
  global variable is like stringy cheese on a slice of pizza. It ends up dragging a whole bunch
  more with the function than you really want. You need the variable <em>and</em> you need all the
  stuff in <span class="code">main</span> where it is given a value. Ugh.</p>
<p>The trick of using function parameters to pass information from one function to another works
  very well---provided one function calls another. Where global variables are useful is where two
  functions that don't call each other want to share information. There are tricks you can use to
  do without globals even in such cases, but there comes a point where the tricks are not worth
  the effort. Global variables are useful, but using them properly requires experience and
  caution. If you don't need to use them, then stay away from them. Declare everything local if
  you can.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>A variable declared inside curly braces is said to be "local" to the block defined by those
      braces. That variable can only be used in that block. A variable declared outside the bodies
      of all functions is said to be "global". It can be used in any function in the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There can be many local variables with the same name in a single program. A local variable
      in one function will not conflict at all with a similarly named local variable in another
      function.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you declare a local variable with the same name as a global variable, the global
      variable is temporarly "hidden" by the local. Any use of that name in the block with the
      local variable will refer to the local variable. In this way, local variables also do not
      conflict with similarly named global variables.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global variables allow two functions to communicate information to each other (one function
      can set the value of the global variable and the other can use that value). However, this
      causes hard to manage dependencies to exist between functions. Modifying and reusing the
      functions is much more difficult. It is better for one function to pass information to
      another using function parameters instead of global variables. However, that technique only
      really works well when the two communicating functions are such that one calls the
      other.</p>
