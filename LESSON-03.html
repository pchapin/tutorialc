<h2>Body</h2>

<h3>Absolute pathnames</h3>

<p>So far all the files you have manipulated on the Unix host have been in a single "directory".
  Windows and Mac users organize files by putting them in "folders". With Unix you can do the same
  thing except that people use the word "directory" instead of "folder". I will use "directory"
  but the exact terminology does not matter to me. If you want to call them folders, that is
  fine.</p>

<p>Directories can contain files and subdirectories. The subdirectories can contain more files and
  other subdirectories. The ability to "nest" directories inside of other directories is very
  important. It makes it possible for the system to store many thousands of files and yet have
  them all organized in a reasonable way. Other operating systems support these same features for
  the same reasons.</p>

<p>Directories have names just like files have names. The only exception is the top-level
  directory, called the "root" directory. Its name is a single slash character. NOTE: In Unix the
  root directory's name is a forward slash. In Windows it is the back slash. These are different
  characters so if you are used to Windows, be careful.</p>

<pre>
  /       Forward slash
  \       Back slash
</pre>

<p>There are many directories on the system. When you log in you are placed into your own personal
  home directory. My home directory has a full name of /home/pchapin. Let's take a closer look at
  this name.</p>

<pre>
  /               The root directory.
  /home           A subdirectory named "home" of the root directory.
  /home/pchapin   A subdirectory named "pchapin" of the "home" directory.
</pre>

<p>The full name "/home/pchapin" is thus like a road map describing how to get to my home
  directory. It says, "starting at the root, go into the directory named home and from there look
  for the thing named "pchapin" (which happens in this case to be another directory)". Because the
  full name gives the path for getting someplace it is called an "absolute pathname". It is called
  absolute because it always starts at the root directory. The leading slash tells you this.</p>

<p>Now consider the absolute pathname to a particular file in my home directory.</p>

<pre>
  /home/pchapin/afile.txt
</pre>

<p>Starting at the root directory, go into the home subdirectory. From there go into the pchapin
  subdirectory and look for the thing named "afile.txt" (which happens in this case to be a file).
  Although my afile.txt is a file, there is really no way to know that by looking at its absolute
  pathname. For all you can tell, I might have a subdirectory in my home directory named
  "afile.txt".</p>

<p>Absolute pathnames can be very long. For example:</p>

<pre>
  /home/pchapin/programming/problem_1/backup/first_attempt/hello.c
</pre>

<p>This pathname mentions several directories that are nested inside of each other, starting at
  the root, that you must visit before you can locate the file hello.c. I have made the names of
  the directories suggestive and realistic. Notice how one might put all files related to a
  particular project in a single directory. This is a good thing to do and I highly recommend
  it.</p>

<h3>The working directory</h3>

<p>Absolute pathnames are nice because they spell everything out so there can be no confusion
  about which file you are talking about. However, they can also be long and tedious to type. For
  this reason the system keeps track of a "working directory" for every user (really for every
  process). You can access files in your working directory by typing their names directly. You
  don't need to use an absolute pathname to refer to them.</p>

<p>Let's take another look at the prompt (your actual prompt might look different depending on the
  configuration of the particular machine you are using)</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  /home/pchapin 1$
</pre>

<p>The first word of this prompt is the current working directory. All plain file names that I use
  will refer to files in the /home/pchapin directory. If I want to refer to a file in some other
  directory that is fine. I could use an absolute pathname to do it.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp /usr/doc/somefile.txt somefile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command copies the file "somefile.txt" out of the "/usr/doc" directory and puts the copy
  into my working directory under the name "somefile.txt".</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp /usr/doc/somefile.txt afile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command is similar to the previous one except that the copy made in my working directory
  has the name "afile.txt" instead of "somefile.txt".</p>

<h3>Relative pathnames</h3>

<p>I said that simple names refer to files in the working directory. It's actually a bit more
  complicated (and flexible) than that. Let me explain using an example</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp somefile.txt backup/afile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command copies somefile.txt out of the working directory and puts the copy into the
  directory named "backup" that is below the working directory. The copy will be named
  "afile.txt." The name backup/afile.txt is called a relative pathname. Like an absolute pathname,
  it tells you how to locate a file. However, instead of using the root directory as the starting
  point, it uses the working directory as the starting point. A simple name like "afile.txt" all
  by itself is really a relative pathname that contains no subdirectory specifiers.</p>

<p>Let me summarize the differences between absolute and relative pathnames.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Absolute pathnames</dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>Always start with a slash.</li>
      <li>Indicate the file's location starting from the root directory.</li>
      <li>Refer to the same file no matter what the working directory.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>Relative pathnames</dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>Never start with a slash.</li>
      <li>Indicate the file's location starting from the working directory.</li>
      <li>Refer to different files as the working directory changes.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>A simple name like "afile.txt" is a relative pathname that refers to a file in the working
  directory.</p>

<h3>The special "." and ".." directories</h3>

<p>Every directory on the system has two special subdirectories. The "." directory represents the
  working directory. The ".." directory represents the directory which contains the working
  directory. Here are some examples.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp afile.txt ../afile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command copies afile.txt to the directory that contains the working directory. If the
  working directory was /home/pchapin at the time, this command would (attempt) to copy afile.txt
  to the /home directory. It would have the same effect as</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp afile.txt /home/afile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>except that the second command uses an absolute pathname.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp /usr/doc/afile.txt ./bfile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command copies the file /usr/doc/afile.txt to the working directory under the name
  "bfile.txt". The dot in ./bfile.txt represents a relative pathname to the working directory.</p>

<p>The "." and ".." directories are relative pathnames. Their meaning changes as the working
  directory changes. You can use them as components of pathnames just like any other
  directory.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp /usr/doc/afile.txt ../../bfile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>This command copies the file /usr/doc/afile.txt to a new place. Where? The first ".." means go
  up one level in the directory structure ("up" means towards the root directory and "down" means
  away from the root directory). Suppose the working directory was /home/pchapin. Then the ".."
  means "go to /home". The second ".." means go up another level. From /home we would go to the
  root directory. So the command (attempts) to copy the file to a file named bfile.txt in the root
  directory. It would have the same effect as</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp /usr/doc/afile.txt /bfile.txt</span>
</pre>

<h3>Typing shortcuts</h3>

<p>Many commands that take a file and somehow move it some place else are perfectly happy if you
  give them a directory as the destination. To see what I mean, first look at this command</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp afile.txt backup/afile.txt</span>
</pre>

<p>Here I'm trying to copy a file from the working directory into a subdirectory named backup.
  Notice that I want to give the copy the same name as the original. In that case, I don't really
  have to mention the file name.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp afile.txt backup</span>
</pre>

<p>The cp command will notice that backup is actually a directory and it will assume that I want
  to copy afile.txt into that directory under the same name. This is a very handy feature. The mv
  command works the same way.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">mv afile.txt backup</span>
</pre>

<p>Here I'm moving afile.txt out of my working directory and into the subdirectory named backup.
  In fact, you can copy or move several files at once between directories in this way.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp first.c second.c third.c backup</span>
</pre>

<p>Since the last argument to cp is the name of a directory, this command makes sense (otherwise
  it would be hard to understand!). It copies the three named files into the backup subdirectory,
  giving them the same names in the process.</p>

<p>Since the shell expands wildcards into a list of file names before trying to execute a command,
  you might really want to type something like</p>

<pre class="terminal">
  $ <span class="user-input">cp *.c backup</span>
</pre>

<p>To copy all .c files into the backup subdirectory.</p>

<h3>Directory commands</h3>

<p>These commands are all very fine, but you are probably wondering how you create and use your
  own directories. There are three commands you need to know.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>cd</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the cd command (change directory) to modify the working directory. For example</p>

    <pre class="terminal">
  /home/pchapin 1$ <span class="user-input">cd ..</span>
  /home 2$
</pre>

    <p>By giving the cd command the special ".." directory, I changed the working directory to be
      the one that contained my old working directory. The prompt changed to reflect this. Here is
      another example, this time using an absolute pathname.</p>

    <pre class="terminal">
  /home 2$ <span class="user-input">cd /usr/bin</span>
  /usr/bin 3$
</pre>

    <p>You would change the working directory if you planned to work with many of the files in
      that directory. That way you could use short, relative pathnames to manipulate those files
      and save yourself a lot of typing.</p></dd>

  <dt>mkdir</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Use the mkdir (make directory) command to create a new directory.</p>

    <pre class="terminal">
  /home/pchapin 1$ <span class="user-input">mkdir programming</span>
  /home/pchapin 2$ <span class="user-input">cd programming</span>
  /home/pchapin/programming 3$
</pre>

    <p>The first command creates a programming directory beneath my current working directory.
      Note that "programming" is a relative pathname. The next command changes to that directory
      so that I can work with files in it more easily. The prompt changes to reflect my new
      working directory.</p></dd>

  <dt>rmdir</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The rmdir (remove directory) command deletes directories. Use this command to erase a
      directory that you no longer need.</p>

    <pre class="terminal">
  /home/pchapin/programming 1$ <span class="user-input">cd ..</span>
  /home/pchapin 2$ <span class="user-input">rmdir programming</span>
</pre>

    <p>To remove a directory with rmdir the directory must be empty and it must not be anyone's
      working directory.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>File permissions</h3>

<p>Unix is a multi-user system. Since several people can use the system at once it allows you to
  control who can access your files and how. Although you probably won't need to mess with your
  file's permission settings during this course, you should at least know the basics about the
  subject if you are to be a knowledgable Unix user.</p>

<p>You can see the permissions for a file using the "ls -l" command. The permissions are in the
  left hand column of the output. To interpret the permissions you also need to notice the file's
  owner and associated group. Those are given in the two middle columns. For example a file might
  show:</p>

<pre>
  Permissions     Owner           Group           Name
  -rw-r--r--      pchapin         users           afile.txt
</pre>

<p>The permissions are given by nine bits of information, divided into three sections of three
  bits. In the permissions above these three sections are:</p>

<pre>
  rw-     Permissions that apply to the owner.
  r--     Permissions that apply to the group.
  r--     Permissions that apply to everyone else.
</pre>

<p>The first dash means that this file is an ordinary file (as opposed to a directory, socket,
  pipe, device special file, etc). The 'r' permission is for reading the file and the 'w'
  permission is for writing to the file. In my example above the owner (pchapin) can read and
  write the file. Anyone in the group users can read the file and, for that matter, so can
  everyone else.</p>

<p>Every normal user on the system is in the group "users". In that respect the users group is
  sort of like the public. This might seem a little silly. Keep in mind, however, that additional
  groups could be defined. For example, the administrator could create a new group and put a few,
  but not all, users into that group (it is possible for a user to be in several groups at once).
  Then file and directory permissions could be set using the group permissions as a way of
  allowing certain resources to be shared among some users without giving access to those
  resources to everyone.</p>

<p>I've mentioned the r and w permissions. You might be wondering what the last permission bit is.
  That bit is used to allow execute access. For example, suppose the permissions on a file were
  rwxr-x---. This would allow the file's owner full access (read, write, and execute). People in
  the same group as the file would be able to read and execute the file, but not modify it.
  Everyone else on the system would have no access at all.</p>

<p>Here are a few common configurations of permission bits and their meaning</p>

<pre>
  rw-r--r--       Everyone has access. Only the owner can modify.
  rwxr-xr-x       Same as above, except this is a program.
  rw-rw----       Full access for the owner and group only.
  rwxrwx---       Same as above, except this is a program.
  rw-------       Only the owner has access.
  rwx------       Same as above, except this is a program.
  r--r--r--       Read only. Not even the owner can modify.
  --x--x--x       Execute only. This file can't be copied, just run.
  rw-rw-rw-       Everyone has full access. This is probably bad.
</pre>

<p>You can use "ls -l" to view permissions. To change permissions, you can use the "chmod"
  command. See the man page for chmod for more information. You do not need to worry about how
  chmod works in this course, but if you are interested in playing with it, that is fine too.</p>

<h3>Directory permissions</h3>

<p>Directories have permissions just like files. When you do "ls -l" you will see the
  subdirectories with a 'd' as the character to the left of the permission bits (instead of a
  dash). The permission bits themselves are interpreted in much the same way.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">r</td>
    <td>Means you can read the directory. This is necessary to get a listing of files in that
      directory with ls.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">w</td>
    <td>Means you can write to the directory. This is necessary to create new files or remove old
      ones in the directory. You can delete files that you don't have access to if you can write
      to the directory where they are stored.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">x</td>
    <td>Means you can "look up" names in the directory. For example if you refer to a name like
      /usr/doc/somefile.txt you need x permission to /, /usr, and /usr/doc in order to look up the
      next enclosed name.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>I mentioned that the Unix host is configured so that only you have access to your files. Even
  if you create files in your home directory with public access, the public will not be able to
  access them. This is because your home directory was created with rwx----- permissions. Since
  nobody else has r or x permission to your home directory they is no way they can reference the
  files it contains. The permissions on the files themselves don't matter.</p>

<h3>The Superuser</h3>

<p>In any multi-user system there is always one user that is above the law. In order to fix
  problems that arise there must be a special, administra- tive user for which the file and
  directory permissions don't apply. In the Unix universe that user has the name "root". Thus even
  though the permissions on your home directory block all users but you, the user named root can
  still access your files.</p>

<p>The password that applies to the root user is called, naturally, the root password. Just like
  the root of a tree, the root password gives you access to the entire system. There are many
  operations that only root can do, thus preventing an ordinary user from causing havock either
  accidently or maliciously (accidents are usually a bigger concern day to day).</p>

<p>The system administrator, of course, has the root password. Without it, he or she could not
  configure the system. However, the administrator should not do normal things while logged in as
  root. Under traditional Unix, root is all powerful---an undesirable design from a computer
  security point of view---thus a mistake done as root could have disastrous consequences.
  Administrators should avoid being root unless it is absolutely necessary. Even system
  administrators spend most of their time logged in as an ordinary user.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol id="summary-list">
  <li><p>An absolute pathname always starts with a slash. It lists all the directories you must
    traverse, starting at the root directory, to get to a file. Absolute pathnames specify a file
    without regard to the current working directory. Relative pathnames never start with a slash.
    They give a (possibly empty) list of directories you must traverse, starting at the working
    directory, to get to a file. They are often much shorter for the files you actually want to
    work with.</p></li>

  <li><p>Use cd to change the working directory, mkdir to create a new directory, and rmdir to
    remove a directory. Typically you put all the files that pertain to a particular project in a
    directory you make for that purpose. When you want to work on that project, you change to that
    directory so that all the files can be accessed with short relative names.</p></li>

  <li><p>Every file has an owner. The files you create are owned by you. Every file is in a group.
    The files you create will be in the default group of users (of which every ordinary user is a
    member). File permissions can be viewed with the "ls -l" command. They consist of a read
    permission, a write permission, and an execute permission for the owner, the group, and
    everyone else. Each permission can be on or off. Directories have permissions too. By default
    the permissions on your home directory allow only the owner (you) access to the files
    contained in that directory.</p></li>
