<h1>Lesson #13</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Debugging Using the Debugger</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="note">This is the GDB version of this lesson. It is my intention to one day produce
  other version of this lesson appropriate for other debuggers.</p>
<p>In this lesson I will cover the following topics</p>
<ol id="overview-list">

<h2>Body</h2>
<h3>Source level debuggers</h3>
<p>Debugging a program by inserting <span class="code">printf</span> statements into it is often
  quite effective. But it has drawbacks.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually you don't want those extra <span class="code">printf</span> statements there.
      That means you have to take them out before you compile your "final" version. If a new bug
      becomes apparent you then have to put them all back in again to debug the new problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It's hard to know ahead of time just what information you want to print in your <span
        class="code">printf</span> statements. If you aren't printing the information you need you
      have to modify your program and do another test run. Yet test runs can sometimes take a long
      time to reach the place where the bug is happening. Thus making such changes can be very
      annoying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are times when you just can't <span class="code">printf</span> the information you
      need. Difficult bugs need more aggressive treatment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully special debugging tools have been created to help. They are called "symbolic
  debuggers". These programs are usually quite sophisticated. They allow you to execute your
  program in slow motion, view and change the values of any variable at any time, and perform a
  number of other operations on the program. A symbolic debugger allows you to dissect your
  program while it is alive. It is similar to performing surgery on your program and observing
  what its inards are doing while they are working (or not working as the case may be).</p>
<p>Every serious compiler that I've heard of comes with a symbolic debugger. Every debugger is a
  little different. Each vendor tries to make their products more attractive than the next one by
  giving their debugger especially nice features. Whenever you start using a new compiler,
  learning your way around its debugger is part of your learning curve.</p>
<p>The gcc compiler comes with a symbolic debugger named gdb. Like gcc, it is free and yet of good
  quality. However, unlike many commercial debuggers, gdb operates purely in text mode. This
  allows it to be used over a terminal connection (good for us), but it does make it a bit more
  difficult to use than some other debuggers. Most debuggers use several windows to show you
  different aspects of your program at once. I will say, however, that gdb is not bad once you get
  used to it.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>For purposes of illustration we need a program to debug. I'll use my prime number testing
  program (Example #1). Here it is again for your reference.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int number;    // The number we are testing.
  int i;         // Loop index.
  int prime = 1; // We start by assuming the number is prime.
  int upper;     // Upper bound of the for loop.

  // Ask the user to enter a number.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;number);

  // Do I like it? If not, print a message and die.
  if (number &lt; 2) {
    printf("Your number is too small.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  // Can I divide this number by anything less than it?
  upper = number;
  for (i = 2; i &lt; upper &amp;&amp; prime; i++) {

    // If it divides evenly, it's not prime. Otherwise I can adjust upper.
    if (number % i == 0) {
      prime = 0;
    }
    else {
      upper = number / i;
    }
  }

  // What is the result of my test?
  if (prime) {
    printf("The number %d is prime!\n", number);
  }
  else {
    printf("I'm sorry, %d is not prime. It can be divided by %d\n",
      number, i - 1);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>To make life more interesting, we should introduce a bug into this program. Lets change the
  line that says</p>
<pre class="code">
upper = number / i;
</pre>
<p>so that it says</p>
<pre class="code">
upper = number % i;
</pre>
<p>This causes the value of <span class="code">upper</span> to be set incorrectly. It will be
  given a small value much too early and the for loop will end prematurely. As a result every odd
  number will appear to be prime. Even numbers will be caught as non prime right away so the bug
  won't "trigger" for even numbers.</p>
<p>This error is not abnormal. People often make mistakes like this. After all, the expression
  <span class="code">number % i</span> is used earlier in the program. It is easy to see how the
  programmer might have accidently typed it again. While the programmer might notice this error by
  just inspecting the program later, it is also possible that something like this could go
  unnoticed for quite some time. It is often amazing the sort of bugs that people don't notice!
</p>
<h3>Preparing to use gdb</h3>
<p>Before I talk about gdb in particular, I want to give you a couple of warnings about
  debuggers.</p>
<p>First using a debugger effectively takes practice. The first few times you do it you will spend
  far more time working (fighting?) with the debugger than you will actually looking for your bug.
  That is normal; don't let it get you down. The debugger might seem like more trouble than it's
  worth at first, but as you get better with it your feelings about it will change. Eventually
  you'll be able to get around in the debugger very well and you'll be able to quickly locate bugs
  that would have taken you hours to find the old fashion way. BUT... it does take practice to get
  to that point. Don't worry if your first few times seems like a waste of time.</p>
<p>Second, using a debugger requires THINKING! Some students seem to go into a trance when they
  use a debugger. They just push buttons and watch their program with a glazed expression. There
  is usually a critical moment when the bug "happens". If you miss that moment all the debugging
  in the world isn't going to help you. To catch that moment you have to pay close attention to
  what is going on. Before you execute each debugger command ask yourself: "what should the
  program do here?" When the command finishes ask yourself: "what did the program actually do?" If
  the program did something different than what you expected, try to figure out why. Only once
  you've completely understood what happened and why should you try something else. Don't just go
  pushing buttons mindlessly or you will get nowhere.</p>
<p>Before you can use gdb you need to compile your program in a special way. In particular, you
  need to include the -g command line option.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">gcc -g -o prime_broken prime_broken.c</span>
</pre>
<p>This tells gcc to add "debugging information" (also called "symbolic information") to the
  executable file. The debugger uses this information to connect what is going on in the program
  with what you wrote in your .c file. You can still debug a program without this extra
  information in it but you can't use the names of your variables and you can't relate what is
  happening to your .c file. You have to debug the program in raw assembly language and that is
  nasty.</p>
<p>The extra debugging information will cause your program's executable file to become larger.
  Often it doubles the size of your executable file. That is a bad thing. Normally when you get
  the bugs worked out you would recompile your program without the debugging option before you
  ship it.</p>
<p>The debugging information should not affect the speed of your program very much. It is mostly
  all stored as tables of data that the debugger uses. The program itself is unaffected. However,
  when you activate debugging, it is usually wise to turn off all compiler optimization options.
  When you tell the compiler to optimize your program the compiler will sometimes rearrange your
  code to make it faster. Debugging programs that have been rearranged is difficult since the
  actual program is different than what you wrote in your .c file.</p>
<p>Of course the compiler optimizations are supposed to be such that the optimized program still
  has the same effects as before. Thus once you get your program working properly without
  optimizations you should be able to turn on the optimizations and recompile it without any
  problems. Once in a while, however, a bug shows up only when the program is optimized. Those
  bugs are particularly difficult. If you get one of them you either have to do without the
  debugger or try to debug optimized code.</p>
<p>In any case, after using the -g option on the compiler you are now ready to debug your program.
  Type</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">gdb prime_broken</span>
</pre>
<p>to run your program under the control of the debugger. Note that in the command above you are
  running the gdb program. The first (and only) argument to that command is the name of the
  program you wish to debug. Give gdb the name of the executable file. Do not give it the name of
  the source file. Gdb will locate the source file automatically.</p>
<h3>Using gdb</h3>
<p>When you start gdb as above, the prime_broken program is also loaded. However, prime_broken is
  prevented from doing anything by the debugger. Let's look around a bit first. It would be
  helpful if you followed along with your own program as you read this lesson.</p>
<p>You can get help in gdb by typing <span class="user-input">help</span> at its prompt. The gdb
  prompt looks like</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb)
</pre>
<p>So you can get help by doing</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">help</span>
</pre>
<p>You will see that help is divided into several "classes" of help. You can get information on
  all the gdb commands in a class by typing <span class="user-input">help</span> followed by the
  class name. For example</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">help files</span>
</pre>
<p>Gives you a list of all commands that relate to specifying and examining files. You can also do
  <span class="user-input">help</span> followed by the name of a command to get help on a
  particular command. For example</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">help list</span>
</pre>
<p>Gives you help on the list command.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that commands can be abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique. In other words
  when you type a command you only have to type as many letters as necessary to distinguish it
  from all the other commands. It happens that the list command is the only command that starts
  with l (ell). Thus you can execute the list command by just doing</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">l</span>
</pre>
<p>Many commands accept arguments. However, they mostly all have a meaningful and useful default
  action that you get by just typing the command without any arguments. In addition, if you just
  type ENTER at the gdb prompt, gdb will re-execute the last command without any arguments. This
  makes it quite easy to run the same command again and again. As you will see that is often
  something you want to do. These rules save a lot of typing and make gdb a lot faster to use than
  you might expect at first.</p>
<p>If you just issue the <span class="user-input">l</span> command gdb will list 10 lines of your
  program around the beginning of function main. Subsequent <span class="user-input"
  >l</span> commands will step through your program 10 lines at a time. You can do something like
</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">l 21</span>
</pre>
<p>to restart the listing around line 21 (in this case). Notice how gdb numbers all the lines for
  you. You can also do something like</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">l main</span>
</pre>
<p>to restart the listing around the beginning of function <span class="code">main</span>. You
  don't really need to know the line numbers where all of your functions start! Try using the
  <span class="user-input">l</span> command several times (remember: you can just type ENTER to
  re-execute a command). Use the <span class="user-input">l</span> command to jump to a line
  number. Use the <span class="user-input">l</span> command to jump to the beginning of <span
      class="code">main</span>.</p>
<p>Okay... let's run our program. Type this</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">run</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb should respond with</p>
<pre class="terminal">
Starting program: /home/pchapin/prime_broken
</pre>
<p>except that it will give the absolute path to the version of prime_broken that you are running
  (in your home directory). The prime_broken program will then do its thing. When it is finished
  gdb will say</p>
<pre class="terminal">
Program exited normally.
(gdb)
</pre>
<p>The "program exited normally" stuff is because main returned a zero. As I explained before,
  zero traditionally means the program ran without a problem. Notice that gdb gives you another
  prompt after the program runs. This allows you to run it again or do other operations.</p>
<p>Notice that the program ran at full speed and without interruption. This is great, but how can
  you debug it that way? You can't. To debug the program you have to get it to stop in the middle
  of what it is doing. One way to do that is to set a "breakpoint". When the program encounters
  the breakpoint it will stop and gdb will step in again. At that point you can work with the
  program more closely.</p>
<p>Typically you set a breakpoint just before the spot where you think the bug "happens". Then you
  can let the program run at full speed to that point and start your serious debugging work from
  there. However, in some cases you really don't know where the bug happens. Let's set a
  breakpoint at the start of function <span class="code">main</span> this time.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">break main</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb might respond with something like</p>
<pre class="terminal">
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80485a6: file prime_broken.c, line 25.
</pre>
<p>This tells you where the break point is located. The strange looking number is the memory
  address of the breakpoint. That is useful if you are a hardcore debugger who is not afraid of
  talking in machine language, but for the most part you can ignore that value.</p>
<p>Now run the program.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">run</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
Starting program: /home/pchapin/prime_broken

Breakpoint 1, main() at prime_broken.c:25
25      int prime = 1; // We start by assuming the number is prime.
</pre>
<p>Gdb runs the program at full speed. However, when the breakpoint is encountered (which happens
  right away in this case) it stops the program in its tracks and displays the line number of the
  break point. Notice that the line displayed is <em>not</em> <span class="code">main</span>'s
  header. That's because <span class="code">main</span>'s header is not executable. There is
  nothing in the final compiled program that corresponds to that header line. The line that
  initialized <span class="code">prime</span> to one is the first executable statement in <span
      class="code">main</span> and so that is where the breakpoint is actually located. Keep in
  mind that his line has not yet executed. The breakpoint stops the program just before the line
  at the breakpoint executes.</p>
<p>Let's see what value <span class="code">prime</span> has at this point</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">print prime</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$1 = 1073783752
</pre>
<p>Here I ask gdb to print out the current value of the variable <span class="code"
>prime</span>. Notice that I had to spell prime exactly right. C is case sensitive so if you use
  uppercase letters in your variable names, you will need to do so when you mention those
  variables to gdb. Gdb printed out a a strange value for <span class="code"
  >prime</span> in this case because I have not yet initialized it. That is normal. The "$1" stuff
  is gdb's way of telling you that this value is being stored in a "gdb variable" for later use.
  That's more of an advanced topic.</p>
<p>Now lets execute line 25 of the program. There are two ways to execute a single line. The <span
    class="user-input">next</span> command goes to the next line. If the current line contains a
  function call, the entire function is executed at full speed. The <span
      class="user-input">step</span> command is just like the next command except that if the
  current line contains a function call, that function is entered and only one line of that
  function is executed. You should probably use <span class="user-input">next</span> most of the
  time. Use <span class="user-input">step</span> only when you want to investigate how a
  particular function is working. Once you are convinced that a function works, you can <span
      class="user-input">next</span> over it from then on.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">n</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
29      printf("Enter a number: ");
</pre>
<p>Instead of typing <span class="user-input">next</span> I just used the abbrviation <span
    class="user-input">n</span>. If I wanted I could step the next line by just typing ENTER.
  PLEASE: do not go into a trance at this time!! It is so easy to just sit there typing ENTER over
  and over again without paying any attention.</p>
<p>I want to see if <span class="code">prime</span> got initialized okay.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">print prime</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$2 = 1
</pre>
<p>Cool! <span class="code">prime</span> now has the value of one just as desired. (The "$2" just
  means that this value is being stored in another gdb variable for later use. You can ignore that
  for now).</p>
<p>Okay, now let me next again.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">n</span>
</pre>
<p>Gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
30      scanf("%d", &amp;number);
</pre>
<p>Hey! Why didn't it print out the prompt "Enter a number:"? Actually this is not a bug. The
  terminals are normally line buffered. This means that they normally don't output anything until
  a '\n' character is printed and then they output the entire line all at once (it's faster to do
  it that way). This is why there was no output when you executed the <span
      class="code">printf</span> statement. That particular <span class="code"
  >printf</span> statement does not print a '\n' character.</p>
<p>However, when you use <span class="code">scanf</span> to get some input, the <span
    class="code">scanf</span> function figures that all buffered output probably should be
  displayed first. Thus <span class="code">scanf</span> "flushes" the output buffer before trying
  to read the keyboard. The bottom line is that executing the <span class="code"
  >scanf</span> function will cause <span class="code">printf</span>'s output to appear as well.
  Try it!</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">n</span>
</pre>
<p>Enter a value of 117 when the program prompts you for a number. Next gdb says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
33      if (number &lt; 2) {
</pre>
<p>to show you that it is ready for the next step in the program. Execute the <span
    class="user-input">next</span> command several more times until you get to the line that looks
  like</p>
<pre class="terminal">
43      if (number % i == 0) {
</pre>
<p>This occurs inside the for loop. Just before executing this line check the values of <span
    class="code">number</span> and <span class="code">i</span> using <span
    class="user-input">print number</span> and <span class="user-input">print i</span> commands.
  Make sure the values look normal (they should). Since 117 is not evenly divisible by 2 the body
  of this if statement should not execute. Run the next command again and you should get to the
  line that says</p>
<pre class="terminal">
47      upper = number % i;
</pre>
<p>You can list out a section of your program around line 47 (in this case) with a command
  like</p>
<pre class="terminal">
(gdb) <span class="user-input">l 47</span>
</pre>
<p>This shows you some text both before and after the line so you can see some context. You can
  see from the listing that the program has decided 117 is not evenly divisible by 2 and is now
  ready to adjust the value of <span class="code">upper</span>. Let the program do that and then
  check to see what value it put into upper. Do a <span class="user-input"
  >next</span> command and then <span class="user-input">print upper</span>.</p>
<p>Whoa! You should see that <span class="code">upper</span> now has a value of 1. But that can't
  be right. How did <span class="code">upper</span> go from 117 all the way to 1 in a single loop
  pass? Just before you executed the last statement everything was fine. Now things are messed up.
  The bug has "happened" and the problem seems like it is in the last line. In fact... it is. That
  line should have been</p>
<pre class="code">
upper = number / i;
</pre>
<p>We found the bug.</p>
<p>Now to quit gdb, type the <span class="user-input">quit</span> command. Gdb will warn you that
  a program is running. You can quit anyway. If you do so, gdb will terminate the program at once.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>A source level debugger is a programming tool that allows you to study your program while
      it executes. This helps you to locate bugs that might otherwise be nearly impossible to
      find.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Debuggers are complex tools and have a significant learning curve. The first few times you
      use a debugger you will probably spend more time learning the debugger than debugging your
      program. That is normal. Using a debugger effectively requires thought. It is easy to just
      hit keys without paying attention, but if you do that you will never find the bugs in your
      program no matter how powerful your debugger might be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before you can debug your program with gdb you must first compile it with the -g option.
      That causes the compiler to include debugging information into the executable file. The gdb
      debugger itself allows you to set breakpoints, execute your program a line at a time,
      display the value of variables, and do many other things.</p>
