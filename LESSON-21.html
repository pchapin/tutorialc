<h3>Passing pointers into functions</h3>
<p>Pointers are perfectly ordinary variables. They just happen to hold the address of something
  else. However, there is nothing unusual about the way you pass pointers into functions. Here is
  how it might look.</p>
<pre class="code">
void some_function(int *p)
{
  // I'm giving the address of some integer. I'll call that address p.

  *p = 8;
    // Here I'm modifying the integer using its address to find it.
}

int main(void)
{
  int age;  // Your typical integer.

  some_function(&amp;age);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This example is rather silly since it does nothing useful. However, it shows you how things
  work. The function <span class="code">some_function</span> has been defined to take a pointer to
  integer as its one and only parameter. The name of the parameter is just <span
      class="code">p</span>. In main I created an integer named <span class="code"
  >age</span> and then called <span class="code">some_function</span> using <span
      class="code">age</span>'s address as the argument. When <span class="code"
  >some_function</span> executes it will store an 8 into the memory location pointed at by that
  address. In other words, it will store an 8 into <span class="code">age</span>.</p>
<p>So what is the "point" (ha, ha) of this? There are several things to notice:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Normally functions can't modify their arguments. C uses only "call by value" to pass
      arguments to functions. That is still true. However, by sending the address of a variable to
      a function, the function is able to modify that variable. Thus there is, in effect, a way
      for functions to modify their arguments. The <span class="code"
      >scanf</span> function in the standard library uses this technique. It is very common. When
      you say</p>
    <pre class="code">
int age;

printf("What is your age? ");
scanf("%d", &amp;age);
</pre>
    <p>You are providing <span class="code">scanf</span> with the address of the place where it is
      to deposit the value it scans. You give <span class="code">scanf</span> the address of <span
          class="code">age</span> and it will use that address to modify <span
          class="code">age</span> before it returns. If you just did <span class="code"
      >scanf("%d", age)</span> there would be no way for <span class="code">scanf</span> to modify
      the <span class="code">age</span> variable since it would only be getting a copy of that
      variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Normally functions can only return a single value. This is still true. However, by using
      pointers you can effectively return several values. Here's how it might look</p>
    <pre class="code">
void some_function(int *p1, int *p2, int *p3)
{
  // blah

  *p1 = return_1;
  *p2 = return_2;
  *p3 = return_3;
}

int main(void)
{
  int result1, result2, result3;

  some_function(&amp;result1, &amp;result2, &amp;result3);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
    <p>In this example <span class="code">some_function</span> wants to return three different
      integers. Instead of just returning only one in the usual way, it requires that its caller
      provide three integer "place holders" to hold the results. The caller then must give <span
          class="code">some_function</span> the addresses of those place holders so that <span
          class="code">some_function</span> can fill them in with appropriate values. This
      technique is very common.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Other languages do these things differently. Some languages have several different ways of
  specifing parameters. Pascal has a concept of "VAR" parameters and Ada uses "IN OUT" parameters.
  Such parameters provide a value to the function and can be modified by the function. C does not
  have these features. It doesn't need them. C just uses pointers.</p>
<h3>The classic swapping example</h3>
<p>I really can't emphasize too much how function parameters work. I would be remiss in my duties
  as an instructor if I didn't show you the example of a swapping function.</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to write a function that could swap two integers. At first you might try
  this</p>
<pre class="code">
void swap(int A, int B)
{
  int temp;

  temp = A;
  A = B;
  B = temp;
}
</pre>
<p>The temporary integer is necessary. Without it you end up overwriting one of the values before
  you have used it.</p>
<p>Now you try to use this handy swap function like this</p>
<pre class="code">
int main(void)
{
  int top, bottom;

  // Put something interesting in top and bottom.

  swap(top, bottom);

  // etc...
}
</pre>
<p>This does not work. Do you know why? If not think it over a bit...</p>
<p>Did you think about it?</p>
<p>Okay... remember that in C parameters are passed by value. That means the arguments are <em>copied</em>.
  In this case the values stored in <span class="code">top</span> and <span
      class="code">bottom</span> are copied and the copies are used to initialize <span
      class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> in the function. The function happily
  swaps <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> but the original values in
  <span class="code">top</span> and <span class="code">bottom</span> are not changed.</p>
<p>To do this correctly in C you have to use pointers.</p>
<pre class="code">
void swap(int *A, int *B)
{
  int temp;

  temp = *A;
  *A = *B;
  *B = temp;
}

int main(void)
{
  int top, bottom;

  // etc...

  swap(&amp;top, &amp;bottom);
  // etc...
}
</pre>
<p>This is fine. First <span class="code">swap</span> has been modified so that it takes two
  pointers to int instead of two integers. The temporary variable needs to still be an integer,
  however. I'm not trying to swap addresses! Inside <span class="code">swap</span> I have to use
  the indirection operator a lot to get at the integers <span class="code"
  >A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are pointing at. That's annoying, but not a problem.
</p>
<p>The calling function is very much like it was except that instead of passing <span
    class="code">top</span> and <span class="code">bottom</span> into <span class="code"
>swap</span> it passes the address of <span class="code">top</span> and the address of <span
    class="code">bottom</span>. It is true that those addresses get copied, but so what? The <span
    class="code">swap</span> function uses those addresses to reach back into the calling function
  and modify the variables that are stored there. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<h3>Passing arrays to functions</h3>
<p>C does not allow you to pass an array to a function. This might seem surprising, but consider
  the implications of doing otherwise. Since C only passes copies of arguments to a function,
  passing an array would entail coping the entire array. Since arrays tend to be large copying the
  whole array would be very time consuming. Many functions don't really need the copy so the time
  spent creating it would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>However, you do often want to write functions that work on an array. If you can't pass an array
  to a function, how can you write such a function? The answer is to use pointers. C's handling of
  arrays is such that the pointer solution is very easy. Here is how it might look</p>
<pre class="code">
void sort(int *array)
{
  // Sort the elements of array.
}

int main(void)
{
  int some_numbers[100];

  // Load up some_numbers with values.

  sort(some_numbers);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Here I've defined a sorting function that accepts the address of a single integer as a
  parameter. However, the function will assume that address is actually the beginning of an array
  of integers. In function main I created an array of 100 integers. After loading the array with
  some (presummably unsorted) data I call <span class="code">sort</span> on that array. When I
  call <span class="code">sort</span> I just use the name of the array without an index. The
  compiler takes this to mean the address of the zeroth element of the array---just what the sort
  function is expecting.</p>
<p>You might be wondering how <span class="code">sort</span> knows the size of the array. After
  all, sort is just getting a single address. There is nothing in that address to indicate the
  array's size. In fact, the sort function that I'm showing above does <em>not</em> know the size
  of the array! It would just have to assume some size and would thus only be able to sort arrays
  of exactly that size. That is a problem. A more realistic sort function might look like this</p>
<pre class="code">
void sort(int *array, int size)
{
  // Do the sorting.
}

int main(void)
{
  int some_numbers[100];

  // Load up some_numbers.

  sort(some_numbers, 100);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This sort function takes a second parameter that defines the size of the array. Now when <span
    class="code">sort</span> is called, the size must be provided. This approach is actually quite
  flexible. What if I only wanted to sort the second half of the array? No problem:</p>
<pre class="code">
sort(&amp;some_numbers[50], 50);
</pre>
<p>I could sort the last quarter of the array like this</p>
<pre class="code">
sort(&amp;some_numbers[75], 25);
</pre>
<p>In these calls, I have to use the "address of" operator and the indexing operator (the square
  brackets). The cute trick with the array name only works if you want the address of the
  beginning of the array. It is very important that I provide the right count. Whatever happens, I
  don't want to tell sort to manipulate array elements that don't exist. For example, the
  following would be bad</p>
<pre class="code">
sort(some_numbers, 101);
</pre>
<p>In this case I'm telling <span class="code">sort</span> that there are 101 elements. In fact
  the array has only 100. Eventually as <span class="code">sort</span> works it will get around to
  manipulating that non-existant array element and then undefined things will happen (core dump!).
  Something like this has the same problem</p>
<pre class="code">
sort(&amp;some_numbers[75], 26);
</pre>
<p>Do you see why?</p>
<p>Another thing to watch out for are errors like the following</p>
<pre class="code">
int main(void)
{
  int *array;

  sort(array, 100);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>The compiler will not object to this. The sort function takes a pointer to integer and an
  integer as parameters and that is exactly what you are giving it. However, <span
      class="code">array</span> is an uninitialized pointer. It contains an undefined address.
  Thus <span class="code">sort</span> will attempt to sort 100 random integers at a random place
  in memory. Core dump! People write code like this fairly often. They see that <span
      class="code">sort</span> expects a pointer to integer and they assume that they have to
  declare a pointer to integer in order to satisfy it. Yet what <span class="code"
  >sort</span> really wants is a pointer to the first integer in an array of integers. You need to
  declare an array, not a pointer to make sort happy.</p>
<p>Read the above paragraph again. The error I'm illustrating here is extremely common and even
  seasoned C programmers have been known to make it. When you see a function that expects a
  pointer parameter don't assume that you should declare a pointer for it. Many such functions are
  really designed to work on arrays.</p>
<p>Using an integer is one obvious way to specify the size of an array. Another way is to give
  sort a pointer to both the beginning and the end of the array. It might look like this</p>
<pre class="code">
void sort(int *first, int *last)
{
  // sort the array between first and last.
}

int main(void)
{
  int array[100];

  sort(array, array + 100);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>It turns out to be a lot easier for everyone if you define the array by using a pointer to the
  beginning and a pointer just past the end. The name <span class="code">array</span> represents
  the address of the zeroth element and <span class="code">array + 100</span> is the address of
  the first non-existant element (<span class="code">array[100]</span>). The sort function needs
  to be written with the understanding that <span class="code"
  >last</span> is just past the end of the array, but that turns out to be easier anyway.</p>
<p>In any case, no matter how you do it, <span class="code">sort</span> will need to be told how
  large the array is. The address of the beginning of the array is not enough information for
  <span class="code">sort</span> to figure that out on its own. This is different than the way
  some other languages work. In many languages you can pass an array to a function and the size of
  the array is information that is "attached" to the array in some way. C is not like that.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>You can pass a pointer to a function the same way you pass any other type of variable. For
      example,</p>
    <pre class="code">
void some_function(int *p)
{
  ...
}
</pre>
    <p>This defines <span class="code">some_function</span> to take a pointer to integer as a
      parameter. When you call <span class="code">some_function</span> you either have to give it
      a pointer to integer or you can take the address of some suitable integer variable
      (depending on your needs). <span class="code">some_function</span> will get a copy of the
      pointer but it can still access whatever original variable that pointer was pointing at. In
      this way <span class="code">some_function</span> is able to, in effect, modify the argument
      you give it.</p>
    <p>You can pass a pointer to a function as a way of getting around the restriction that
      functions only get copies of their arguments. You can also pass (several) pointers to a
      function to allow the function to effectively return several different values. The function
      would use the pointers to access "place holder" variables defined in the calling
      program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can't pass arrays to functions directly, but you can give a function a pointer to the
      first element of an array. When the function is called, you just pass it the array name
      without an index. Inside the function you can treat the pointer as a pointer, or you can
      apply an index to it again and use it as an array.</p>
    <p>Since a pointer to the first element of an array does not tell you how large the array is,
      you have to arrange some other way of getting that information to your function. You can
      either pass the size as a separate parameter, or pass two pointers that define the start and
      end of the array.</p>
