<h3>Why multiple files?</h3>
<p>So far all of the programs we have talked about have been entirely contained in a single .c
  file. This is practical and appropriate for small programs but it is not a satisfactory way to
  organize large programs. If many people are working on the same program it is much easier if
  each programmer can edit and maintain their own .c file(s). The final program can then be built
  from all the various .c files together. Often you will use libraries written by people you don't
  even know. These libraries might come in one (or more) .c files of their own. Rather than
  cutting and pasting all the functions in such a library into each of your own programs, it is
  much easier to just build your programs from all the various .c files involved.</p>
<p>Even if you are the only person working on your program, you will still want to use several .c
  files if the program is reasonably large. It is extremely tedious to edit enormous files and the
  compiler will be very slow in processing such files. By putting different parts of your program
  in different files you make each file much more managable. In addition you can use files to help
  organize your program. Perhaps you put all the functions that do computations in one file and
  all the functions that do I/O in another file. Then when you are looking for a particular
  function you can find it more easily.</p>
<p>A "small" serious program is likely to consist of 10,000 to 50,000 lines of C spread out over
  10 or 20 .c files. Much larger programs are common. I understand that Windows 2000 is over 10
  million lines of C spread over thousands of files. Although this first course won't, by itself,
  make you into a professional C programmer, you should have the skills once we are finished to
  grapple with an existing "small" program. That means you need to know something about how
  programs are divided into different files.</p>
<h3>Okay, so how does it work?</h3>
<p>Let me play with my old example of a prime number testing program. I will put the function
  <span class="code">is_prime</span> in a separate file. First here is the file containing <span
      class="code">is_prime</span>. I will call this file prime.c.</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int number)
{
  int i;

  // Very small numbers are errors. Errors are not prime.
  if (number &lt; 2) return 0;

  // Otherwise, just check all numbers less than Number for divisability.
  for (i = 2; i &lt; number; i++) {
    if (number % i == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
  }

  // If I got here the number must be prime.
  return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>This file only contains <span class="code">is_prime</span>. It does not contain main. It also
  doesn't need to <span class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span> since it does not use any of
  the I/O functions that are declared there.</p>
<p>Now here is the file containing main. I will call it prime-check.c</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int is_prime(int);

int main(void)
{
  int my_number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;my_number);

  // Print out an appropriate message.
  if (is_prime(my_number)) {
    printf("The number, %d, is prime!\n", my_number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is not prime!\n", my_number);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This file contains <span class="code">main</span>, but does not contain <span
    class="code">is_prime</span>. However, to keep the compiler happy I have included a
  declaration of <span class="code">is_prime</span> just before main. Otherwise the compiler might
  misinterpret how <span class="code">is_prime</span> is to be used.</p>
<p>To build this program now requires several steps.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -c prime.c</span>
$ <span class="user-input">cc -c prime-check.c</span>
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o prime-check prime-check.o prime.o</span>
</pre>
<p>The first command compiles prime.c. The -c option prevents the compiler from trying to build
  the final executable file (think: -c for "compile only"). Such an attempt would fail because
  there is no main in prime.c. After the first command there would be a prime.o in your working
  directory.</p>
<p>The second command compiles prime-check.c in a manner similar to the way I did prime.c. As with
  the first command, no executable file is made. Instead the compiled file is stored in
  prime-check.o.</p>
<p>The final command combines the two .o files into a final executable file named prime-check. The
  final executable can now be run without either the .c files or the .o files being present. As
  before it stands by itself as a complete program.</p>
<p>Actually the cc program is a bit smarter than I'm letting on here. In fact, you could build
  your program by just doing</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o prime-check prime-check.c prime.c</span>
</pre>
<p>Since I mention more than one .c file on the command line, cc understands this to mean that it
  should compile both of them and combine the result into the final output file. The disadvantage
  to doing this is that cc will always compile both files. However, if you make a change to just
  one of them, there is no need to rebuild the other .o file. Suppose I just change
  prime.c---perhaps to enhance the is_prime function. I can build a new version of prime-check
  like this</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -c prime.c</span>
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o prime-check prime-check.o prime.o</span>
</pre>
<p>There is no need to recompile prime-check.c since I have not changed it.</p>
<p>Actually I can also do this</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o prime-check prime-check.o prime.c</span>
</pre>
<p>In this case I'm specifying a .o file to cc and a .c file. The cc program understand that it
  needs to compile the .c file and combine the resulting .o file with prime-check.o to make the
  final output.</p>
<p>Now imagine a large project consisting of many .c files. When you change one of them you only
  need to recompile that one file and then recombine all the .o files to form a new executable.
  Linking the .o files together is fairly quick and compiling a single .c file is, obviously,
  faster than compiling a bunch of them. In fact, it will be significantly faster than compiling
  the program as stored in one, huge .c file. This is one advantage to breaking your program into
  separate files. It will build more quickly after you make a change.</p>
<h3>Header files</h3>
<p>Notice how I had to include a declaration of <span class="code">is_prime</span> in
  prime-check.c? This is normal. Since the definition of <span class="code">is_prime</span> is now
  in another file and since the compiler only looks at one file at a time, it is now necessary to
  include a declaration of <span class="code">is_prime</span> in prime-check.c so that the
  compiler understands that the function exists. You could easily enough use prime.c in a
  different program, but you would also have to include a declaration of <span
      class="code">is_prime</span> in that other program as well.</p>
<p>To simplify this you would create a header file that contains just the declaration.
  Traditionally header files end with a .h. Here is what prime.h looks like</p>
<pre class="code">
int is_prime(int);
</pre>
<p>Now you include this header file in your prime-check.c file. Here is the revised version of
  prime-check.c</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "prime.h"

int main(void)
{
  int my_number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;my_number);

  // Print out an appropriate message.
  if (is_prime(my_number)) {
    printf("The number, %d, is prime!\n", my_number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is not prime!\n", my_number);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Notice how I've replaced the declaration of <span class="code">is_prime</span> with <span
    class="code">#include "prime.h"</span>. When the compiler processes prime-check.c it will go
  and read prime.h as if you had typed its contents directly into prime-check.c. Thus, in effect,
  this example is exactly like the earlier one. The declaration of <span
      class="code">is_prime</span> occurs before it is used just as desired.</p>
<p>Creating a header file that contains declarations of all the functions in a .c file is the
  normal procedure. Since most .c files contains many functions it is much easier to include a
  header than it is to manually type all the necessary declarations. In programs that are composed
  of many .c files, there are typically many .h files as well.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've noticed the similarlity between the two lines</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "prime.h"
</pre>
<p>In fact, when you use functions in the standard library you are using functions defined in
  separate files. The file stdio.h contains declarations for all the I/O functions in the standard
  library. Just as with <span class="code">is_prime</span>, the compiler wants to see those
  declarations before you start using those functions. Instead of you having to type those
  declarations in yourself, you can just include an appropriate header file.</p>
<p>The angle brackets around stdio.h tell the compiler that this is a "standard" header file and
  that it should look in the "standard" places for it. Typically the standard place for header
  files is the directory /usr/include. However, the quotation marks around prime.h tell the
  compiler that it is a "user defined" header and that it should look in the working directory for
  it instead.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that doing <span class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span> does NOT cause the
  definitions of <span class="code">printf</span>, etc to become part of your program. It merely
  allows the compiler to see the declarations of those functions. The actual definitions of <span
      class="code">printf</span> are stored in a special library file elsewhere. A library file is
  an archive of many .o files that were created when the various .c files comprising the standard
  library were compiled. The compiled .o files from the standard library are combined with your
  program by cc only to make the final executable file.</p>
<p>Students are sometimes surprised to learn that the standard library functions like <span
    class="code">printf</span> and <span class="code">scanf</span> were written in C and compiled
  with the same C compiler they are using. Don't be. Such is the nature of C. The standard library
  is just another library. As you will see shortly, you can create your own libraries. The
  compiler can't really tell the difference. If you wanted to, you could even write your own
  version of <span class="code">printf</span> and arrange to use your version all the time instead
  of the one that comes with the compiler. I don't suggest doing that unless you know what you are
  doing!</p>
<h3>Some terminology</h3>
<p>Before going any further I need to introduce some terminology. So far in this course I've
  talked about .c files and now I'm talking about .o files. Programmers, however, use different
  words to talk about these files.</p>
<p>The stuff you write is called the "source code" of the program. If you ask someone for a
  program's "source" you are asking for the .c files (and .h files) that were used to create it.
  Program source code is very valuable. By inspecting the source code of a program you can learn
  how it does things. You can locate bugs, security loopholes, and undocumented features. With a
  program's source you can modify the program and borrow (or steal, depending on your point of
  view) its ideas.</p>
<p>When you compile a source file, the output of the compiler is a file containing machine
  instructions. This is called the "object code". In the Unix environment such files end with .o
  (for "object"). In the Windows world they typically (but not always) end with .obj. The object
  files are binary files and are not intended for direct manipulation by people.</p>
<p>After the compiler creates the object code, another program, called a linker, combines various
  object files together to form the final "executable code". Some of the object files comprising a
  program are created by the programmer. Other object files are taken out of special libraries of
  object files. That is how the standard library is handled. In a large program there might be
  hundreds of object files and each object file might contain the compiled code from many
  functions. Yet when the linking is done the end user only needs the single executable file. The
  source code and object code does not need to be on hand to run the program.</p>
<p>The cc program that we've been using is not really a compiler. It is really a front end program
  that coordinates all of this activity. When you say</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o hello hello.c</span>
</pre>
<p>The cc program runs the compiler to translate hello.c to hello.o (actually the file has a very
  strange name and is put into the /tmp directory but that is not important to my discussion).
  Then cc runs the linker to create the executable file hello by combining hello.o with the
  necessary object files from the standard library. Finally cc deletes hello.o to clean things up
  a bit.</p>
<p>When you say</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -c hello.c</span>
</pre>
<p>The cc program only runs the compiler and does not delete hello.o when it is finished.</p>
<p>When you say</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o hello hello.o</span>
</pre>
<p>The cc program runs only the linker. It is possible to run the compiler and linker yourself
  manually, but it is somewhat complicated to do so because there are many options you must
  provide. The cc front end program makes life much easier.</p>
<h3>Linkage</h3>
<p>When you create a program using several files there needs to be a way to "connect" names in one
  file with names in another. The compiler processes only one file at a time. Yet when the program
  is linked together the linker must understand the relationship between the named entities in the
  various files. The concept of "linkage" defines this issue. There are two types of linkage:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If a name has "internal linkage" then that name can only be used in the source file where
      it appears. If there happens to be something with the same name in a different source file,
      the two entities have nothing to do with each other. They are totally independent. In this
      respect internal linkage is a similar concept to that of local variables.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a name has "external linkage" then that name refers to the same entity no matter what
      source file the name appears in. In this respect external linkage is a similar concept to
      that of global variables.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Let's look at some examples to clarify things. Here are the contents of a file named
  file1.c:</p>
<pre class="code">
void f(void);
  // Functions have external linkage by default.

int main(void)
{
  f();   // Call function f in another file.
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Here are the contents of a file named file2.c:</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f(void)
{
  printf("Hello, World\n");
  return;
}
</pre>
<p>Here is a two file example where the main program calls a function named <span
    class="code">f</span> that is located in a separate file. We have already looked at examples
  like this. It works because functions have external linkage by default. Thus there is only one
  function <span class="code">f</span> in the entire program. The <span
      class="code">f</span> being used in main must refer to the same <span class="code"
  >f</span> defined in file2.c.</p>
<p>The rules for global variables are a little different, but this example should clarify. Here
  are the contents of file1.c:</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f(void);    // Declare f.
int number = 0;  // Declare and define number here.

int main(void)
{
  f();  // Call f.
  printf("number = %d\n", number);

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Here are the contents of file2.c:</p>
<pre class="code">
extern int number;  // Declare number. It is defined elsewhere.

void f(void)
{
  number = 1;  // Change the Number in another file.
}
</pre>
<p>In this example, there is only one global integer named <span class="code">number</span>. It
  has been defined in file1.c where it receives its initial value. In file2.c a special "extern"
  declaration exists so that the compiler is made aware of the name (remember the compiler only
  processes one file at a time). However, the compiler will not set aside any memory for <span
      class="code">number</span> in file2.c. It assumes that has already been done some place else
  (in this case in file1.c). The variable <span class="code"
  >number</span> is a simple global variable that can be used by any function in the program. It
  can even be used by functions in other files because it has external linkage.</p>
<p>Now let's look at internal linkage. Here are the contents of file1.c:</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static int number = 0;  // Internally linked global.
static void f(void);    // Internally linked function.

int main(void)
{
  f();  // Call the f in this file.
  printf("number = %d\n", number);

  return 0;
}

static void f(void)
{
  number = 1;
}
</pre>
<p>In this case the declarations of <span class="code">number</span> and of <span
    class="code">f</span> are preceeded with the word <span class="code">static</span>. This is
  misleading. When <span class="code">static</span> is applied to a local variable it changes the
  duration of that variable from automatic duration to static duration. However, when <span
      class="code">static</span> is applied to a global variable it does not change the duration
  (global variables always have static duration). Instead it changes the linkage from external to
  internal. Personally, I think it was a bad idea to reuse the word "static" for this purpose. It
  only serves to confuse people. Probably it was done to avoid introducing another keyword into
  the language. However, I think it is a design flaw in C.</p>
<p>In any case, the global variable number can now only be used by the functions in file1.c.
  Functions in file2.c could not use that variable (although they might have their own internally
  linked variable named <span class="code">number</span>---or even access a externally linked
  variable named <span class="code">number</span>). Similar comments apply to the internally
  linked function <span class="code">f</span>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>Programs are typically made from many .c files. This is done to make it easier for many
      people to work on a single program and to share and organize your functions. To compile a
      program made of two .c files named first.c and second.c do something like this</p>
    <pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">cc -o first first.c second.c</span>
</pre>
    <p>This puts the final program into the executable file named first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The "source code" of a program is the .c and .h files that the programmer(s) created. The
      source code is compiled into machine instructions and is called "object code" after it has
      been compiled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Functions have external linkage by default. You don't have to do anything special to use a
      function from another file aside from declaring it. Typically you put function declarations
      in header files to make them easy to include in the source files that need them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you put the keyword <span class="code">static</span> in front of a function declaration
      you are changing the linkage of that function to internal. In that case it can only be used
      by other functions in the same source file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global variables should be defined in only one place. If you need to access a global
      variable from another file, you should declare that variable with the keyword <span
          class="code">extern</span> in front of it. Such declarations should not contain any
      initializers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global variables that you only need to use in a single file should have the keyword <span
        class="code">static</span> put in front of their declarations. This changes their linkage
      to internal linkage. Despite how it sounds it does not modify the variable's duration
      (globals always have static duration).</p>
