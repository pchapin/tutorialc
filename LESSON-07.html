<h1>Lesson #7</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Conditional Expressions and if Statements</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this lesson I will cover the following topics</p>
<ol id="overview-list">
  <li>
    <p>How C represents the values of true and false.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relational operators.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The if statement and the if/else statement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Body</h2>
<h3>Truth and falsehood</h3>
<p>Often you will want your program to do different things depending on the circumstances.
  Programs often need to adapt to conditions that can only be checked when the program is running.
  To support this, every programming language has special "conditional" statements. These
  statements allow you to test some condition and then execute different instructions depending on
  the outcome of that test.</p>
<p>To understand how this works in C you first need to understand C's attitude about truth and
  falsehood. C is very simple minded (compared to some languages) when it comes to this issue.
  Often students have trouble understanding it because it is so simple minded.</p>
<p>REMEMBER: In C the integer zero is "false". Any non-zero integer is "true".</p>
<p>C differs from many other languages because you can use integers to hold the values of "true"
  and "false". In other languages there might be a special type for this purpose.</p>
<h3>The relational operators</h3>
<p>Now we can talk about the relational operators. These operators perform a test on their
  operands and give the value 0 (false) if the test fails and 1 (true) if the test succeeds. You
  can use these operators in any expression you like although the most common use of them is in
  the "if" statement that I will describe shortly. First let me show you the operators
  themselves.</p>
<pre class="code">
x = (a == b);
</pre>
<p>Here the variable <span class="code">x</span> is given the value 1 if <span class="code"
>a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> are equal. If <span class="code">a</span> and <span
    class="code">b</span> are not equal, <span class="code">x</span> is given the value 0. The
  <span class="code">==</span> operator is informally called the "test for equality" operator.
  Notice that assignment is a single equals sign while test for equality is a double equal sign.
  Do not get them confused! They are very different. Test for equality yields a value of 0 or 1
  and changes neither of its operands. Assignment modifies its left operand and yields a value
  that is the same as its left operand after the assignment is done. Notice also that you can not
  put a space between the equal signs in <span class="code">==</span>. If you try</p>
<pre class="code">
x = (a = = b);
</pre>
<p>The compiler will give you an error.</p>
<p>Here are the other relational operators.</p>
<pre class="code">
x = (a != b);  // True if a is *not* equal to b.
x = (a &gt;  b);  // True if a is greater than b.
x = (a &lt;  b);  // True if a is less than b.
x = (a &gt;= b);  // True if a is greater than or equal to b.
x = (a &lt;= b);  // True if a is less than or equal to b.
</pre>
<p>There is an important difference between <span class="code">&gt;</span> and <span
    class="code">&gt;=</span>. Consider</p>
<pre class="code">
5 &gt; 5   // False!
5 &gt;= 5  // True!
</pre>
<p>Many programming errors arise because programmers are off by one in their calculations. Using
  the wrong relational operator is a big reason for that error occuring. You will see this more
  later.</p>
<h3>The conditional statement</h3>
<p>It is rare to use the relational operators the way I did above. I did it that way only to
  emphasize that they are perfectly ordinary operators just like <span class="code"
  >+</span>, <span class="code">-</span>, etc. I also wanted to emphasize that C treats truth and
  falsehood as integers. Consequently true and false values can be stored in ordinary integer
  variables.</p>
<p>However, the usual way to use relational operators is in the context of an if statement. The if
  statement is very important. You will use it often. Here is an example.</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // Get the user's age.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Check to be sure it is reasonable.
  if (age &lt; 0) {
    printf("That can't be right. Your age is negative!");
    return 1;
  }

  // I like the age. Handle it normally.
  printf("I understand that your age is %d\n", age);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>In this program I ask the user to enter his/her age as an integer. Integer values can be
  negative, but negative ages don't make any sense. To check for that possibility I included an if
  statement. If the condition in the parentheses of the if statement evaluates to true the
  instructions inside the braces of the if statement are executed. If the condition is false, the
  instructions inside the braces of the if statement are skipped.</p>
<p>In this case the body of the if statement executes only if <span class="code">age &lt;
        0</span> is true. That is an error condition so I respond by printing an error message.
  Normally when the body of an if statement finishes executing the program continues after the if
  statement. In this particular example, I execute <span class="code">return 1</span> inside the
  if statement. Since returning from <span class="code">main</span> ends the program, this has the
  effect of ending the program right at that point. I return one instead of zero because a return
  of one from <span class="code">main</span> traditionally means that some sort of error occured.
</p>
<p>Here is another way I might have done it:</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // Get the user's age.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Check to be sure it is reasonable.
  if (age &lt; 0) {
    printf("Negative age given... using zero instead.\n");
    age = 0;
  }

  // We like the age. Handle it normally.
  printf("I understand that your age is %d\n", age);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>In this version, instead of terminating the program if the age is bad, I correct the age by
  giving it a "reasonable" value. It's debatable just how reasonable zero is, but depending on the
  program that might be an appropriate response.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand here is that if the condition in the if is true (bad age
  given), a new value is assigned to <span class="code">age</span> and the program continues
  normally after the if statement. If the condition in the if is false (<span
      class="code">age</span> is acceptable already), the program skips the body of the if and
  just continues normally.</p>
<p>A more realistic version of the program might look like this</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // Get the user's age.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Check a few error conditions.
  if (age &lt; 0) {
    printf("Error: Negative age.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  if (age &gt; 125) {
    printf("Error: Excessive age.\n");
    return 1;
  }

  // We like the age. Handle it normally.
  printf("I understand that your age is %d\n", age);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This version tries to check for both negative ages and excessive ages. Here I assume that no
  user of this program will be more than 125 years old. The idea is to catch cases where the user,
  perhaps not understanding what is being asked, enters a value like 32539 for an age.</p>
<p>Notice that I'm taking an age of 125 as acceptable. The age must be strictly greater than 125
  to trigger the error message. If I had used <span class="code">age &gt;= 125</span> then the
  highest acceptable age would have been only 124. Do you see how "off by one" errors can creep
  into a program? Switching a <span class="code">&gt;</span> to a <span
      class="code">&gt;=</span> in an if statement caused this program to change the range of
  acceptable ages by one. Pay close attention when you are writing your programs so that you can
  avoid creating such errors.</p>
<p>This program tries to catch and handle excessive ages in order to prevent the program from
  working with an age that is obviously an error. However, the value of 125 is arbitrary. Who's to
  say that's an error? Advances in medical technology might allow many people to live to that age
  in the near future. Picture this: a few years down the road you start getting bug reports about
  your program. Here's a typical letter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I'm 128 years old. Yet when I enter my age into your program I am told that my age is
    excessive. Not only do I find that offensive, but your program then refuses to execute
    further. I'm afraid that I will be forced to buy your competitor's products from now on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your innocent attempt to handle error conditions has caused you to irritate customers who don't
  fit your assumptions. In general the more user friendly you try to make your program the more
  assumptions you have to make about your users and the more likely it gets that you will end up
  irritating someone. Welcome to the world of programming!</p>
<h3>if... else...</h3>
<p>I can't end this lesson without talking about the else clause to the if statement. Many times
  you will want to use an if statement to decide which of two possibilities to follow. You might
  want to say "if such-and-such is true, then do this; otherwise do that." To express this in C
  you would use an else clause on your if statement.</p>
<p>Here is an example</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int number;

  // Get a value from the user.
  printf("Pick a number, any number (as long as it's an int): ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;number);

  // Is it even or odd?
  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    printf("The number, %d, is even!\n", number);
  }
  else {
    printf("The number, %d, is odd!\n", number);
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This program asks the user to enter an integer and it then checks to see if that integer is an
  even number or an odd number. To do this check, I first divide the number by 2 and look at the
  remainder. Since even numbers are evenly divisable by 2 there will be no remainder and the
  calculation <span class="code">number % 2</span> would have a value of zero. For odd numbers
  there would be a remainder of 1 so the condition <span class="code"
  >number % 2 == 0</span> would be false.</p>
<p>But wait a second... does the expression <span class="code">number % 2 == 0</span> really do
  what we want? Check the operator precedence chart. There you will see that <span
      class="code">%</span> has higher precedence than <span class="code">==</span>. Thus the
  expression is evaluated as</p>
<pre class="code">
(number % 2) == 0
</pre>
<p>which is, in fact, what we want. Don't take these things for granted! Some of the precedence
  rules are a bit surprising. If in doubt either check the chart or put extra parentheses into
  your expressions.</p>
<p>The body of the if is executed if the condition is true (the value of 2 divides evenly into the
  number). In that case, after the body of the if executes, the program will skip over the else
  clause and continue with whatever follows. On the other hand, if the condition is false, the
  program will skip the body of the if and execute the else clause. Once the else clause is
  finished, the program will continue with whatever follows, just as before.</p>
<p>My first example in this lesson had a return statement inside of an if statement. Many people
  would say that this is a bad thing to do. For a very small program, it is fine. But when
  programs become large returning from several different places is just confusing. If you later
  decide to do something extra just before you end the program, you have to add that extra stuff
  in several places. What if you forget one? A better way to write that first example might be</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
  int age;
  int return_value = 0;

  // Get the user's age.
  printf("What is your age? ");
  scanf("%d", &amp;age);

  // Check to be sure it is reasonable.
  if (age &lt; 0) {
    printf("That can't be right. Your age is negative!");
    return_value = 1;
  }

  // If it is... handle it.
  else {
    printf("I understand that your age is %d\n", age);
  }

  return return_value;
}
</pre>
<p>This version of the program returns in only one place---at the bottom where people expect to
  see it. It returns the value of zero by default, but it will return the value of 1 if an error
  occured. It uses an if statement to check for errors as before. The normal handling is placed in
  an else clause so that it will be skipped if an error happened. In either case the program
  returns at the very end.</p>
<p>In order to write the program this way, I had to introduce a new variable, <span
    class="code">return_value</span>, to "transmit" information from the place where the error
  occured to the place where the return happens. This might seem silly and a waste, but in a large
  program it is probably the better way to do things. Your program will be better organized and
  easier to change and fix if you insure that each block of code (stuff with braces around it)
  gets entered only at the top and exits only at the bottom. When you stick a return statement in
  the middle of a block you are jumping out of the block abruptly and unexpectedly. You should
  avoid that.</p>
<h3>A few words on style</h3>
<p>When you write if statements you should absolutely be sure to indent the statements in the
  block created by the if. Those statements are subordinate to the if and, in effect, controlled
  by it. You want them to have a visual appearance that indicates that. This is very bad
  style:</p>
<pre class="code">
int main(void)
{
  int age;

  // etc...

  if (age &lt; 0) {
  printf("That can't be right! Your age is negative!\n");
  return 1;
  }

  // etc...
}
</pre>
<p>To someone glancing over your program it is not clear that the <span class="code"
>printf</span> and the return are executed conditionally. They seem just as significant as any
  other statement in the program. This is a bad thing. Programs are normally very complicated.
  Some steps require many "sub-steps". The only way a person can cope with the complexity is to
  avoid looking at it all at once. Proper indentation is essential for that. As you will soon see,
  you can nest if statements (and other statements) as much as you like. You should indent the
  statements in each nested block past the statements in the enclosing block. If you don't do this
  you and everyone else looking at your program will become very confused.</p>
<p>Similarly every statement in the same block should be indented the same amount. You want to
  make it clear at a glance that the statements go together. A program is a work of art. It needs
  to look beautiful. Believe it or not, a beautiful looking program works better. They have fewer
  bugs.</p>
<p>My experience as an instructor has been that students often don't indent carefully because
  either a) they don't want to bother or b) they don't really understand how their program fits
  together. Let me assure you that bothering with indentation is well worth the effort. You will
  save hours in debugging time. If you are not sure how your program fits together, then fussing
  with the indentation will help you. Make sure you have a close brace for every open brace and
  make sure your indentation is consistent. It will help make the meaning of your program
  clear.</p>
<p>The VTC style guide requires consistent indentation of blocks. I also recommend inserting blank
  likes here and there to separate your program into related chunks of statements. It is difficult
  for humans to deal with more than about 5 things at once. If you break your program into little
  pieces you will find it easier to understand. I like to put a comment above each chunk of
  code---you can see that in my examples. I encourage you to do the same. The comments are
  important too. They are a way for you to explain to yourself what you are doing.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>In C any non-zero integer is taken to be "true" and the integer zero is taken to be
      "false".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can test conditions by using the <span class="code">==</span>, <span class="code"
    >!=</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span
        class="code">&gt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;=</span> operators. For example, an
      expression like <span class="code">x != y</span> has a value of true (one) if <span
          class="code">x</span> is not equal to <span class="code">y</span>, otherwise it has a
      value of false (zero). Notice that while any non-zero integer is taken to be true, the
      relational operators will always return one to represent true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can conditionally execute a block of code using an if statement. For example</p>
    <pre class="code">
if (x != y) {
  // Do this if the condition is true.
}
else {
  // Do this if the condition is false.
}
</pre>
    <p>The else clause is optional. If you don't need it, you don't have to include it.</p>
