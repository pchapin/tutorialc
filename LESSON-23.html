<h3>Limitations on C strings</h3>
<p>In C strings are primitive. The language treats them exactly like arrays of characters and
  gives them almost no special support. This is different than in many other languages where
  strings are built in types and often have their own special operators. C does not think that way
  and many novice C programmers encounter errors because they assume too much. For example,
  suppose you wanted to compare two strings to see if they were the same. You might be tempted to
  do something like this</p>
<pre class="code">
char string1[128+1];
char string2[128+1];

...

if (string1 == string2) { ... }
</pre>
<p>It doesn't work. The compiler sees you using the name of an array without an index. It thus
  takes that to be the address of the first element of the array. What you are really asking here
  is if the starting address of <span class="code">string1</span> and the starting address of
  <span class="code">string2</span> are the same. Naturally they are not: the two strings are
  stored in different arrays! What is actually in the strings is not considered. Instead to
  compare strings you have to write a function to compare the two arrays (up to their respective
  null bytes) one element at a time. The standard library has such a function. It is called <span
      class="code">strcmp</span>.</p>
<p>Some people also want to copy one string into another using just a plain assignment
  operator</p>
<pre class="code">
string1 = string2;
</pre>
<p>This also doesn't work. To the compiler it looks like you are trying to assign one address to
  another. Normally you can copy pointers, but in this case <span class="code"
  >string1</span> is the address of an array. Since the compiler has already decided where that
  array is going to be located in memory, it won't let you assign a new address to it. You will
  get an "lvalue required" error message. In any case, the actual contents of the string are never
  at issue. If you want to copy a string you need to write a function that will copy the array
  elements one at a time. The standard library has such a function. It is called <span
      class="code">strcpy</span>.</p>
<h3>But strings are a little special</h3>
<p>Actually the C language does give strings a few special perks. Let me talk about those now.</p>
<p>When you use a string literal in your program, the compiler creates an anonymous array of
  characters, initializes it with the characters of your literal&mdash;complete with a null
  character at the end&mdash;and then replaces the literal with the address of the first element
  of that anonymous array. Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="code">
char workspace[128+1];

strcpy(workspace, "Hello, World!");
</pre>
<p>This works as you would expect. The first parameter to <span class="code">strcpy</span> is a
  pointer to the workspace array; it has the type pointer to character. That is where you want the
  string to go. The second parameter also has type pointer to character because string literals
  are actually pointers! The compiler creates a static duration anonymous array of characters,
  fills that array with the characters from "Hello, World!", puts a null byte on the end, and
  passes the address of the first character in that array to strcpy. The end result: it does what
  you want.</p>
<p>One consequence of this is that you can do some very strange things in C that are just errors
  in other languages. Check this out:</p>
<pre class="code">
char hex_digit = "0123456789ABCDEF"[number];
</pre>
<p>Here I'm applying a index (square brackets) to a string literal. Since the compiler regards the
  literal as a pointer and since you can apply square brackets to pointers this is perfectly
  acceptable. In fact, my example is even useful. It looks up an appropriate digit character from
  an array using the numeric value as an index. I don't suggest you do things like this. It will
  baffle people.</p>
<p>When you initialize an array of characters you can use a special syntax to make your life
  easier.</p>
<pre class="code">
char workspace[] = "Hello, World!";
</pre>
<p>Normally you would expect this to be an error (if you don't expect that, think about it for a
  minute). The proper way to initailize an array of characters should be</p>
<pre class="code">
char workspace[] = {
  'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'
};
</pre>
<p>Notice how I explicitly put a null character at the end? Notice also how big a pain this is to
  type? Try typing it. To make creating such arrays easier the compiler understands the special
  syntax I showed above.</p>
<p>Now consider the differences between the following two initialized declarations</p>
<pre class="code">
char p1[] = "Hello!";
char *p2  = "Hello!";
</pre>
<p>There is really very little difference. The variable <span class="code">p1</span> is an array
  and the variable <span class="code">p2</span> is a pointer, but in practice it makes little
  difference to how you can use those variables. In the first case when you say just <span
      class="code">p1</span> in your program the compiler takes that to mean the address of the
  first character of an array. However since <span class="code">p2</span> also points at the first
  character of an array you can use <span class="code">p1</span> and <span
      class="code">p2</span> in very similar ways. You can even put an index on <span
      class="code">p2</span> and write things like</p>
<pre class="code">
if (p2[1] == 'e') { ... }
</pre>
<p>The major difference is that you can't change the value of the address <span class="code"
>p1</span> represents. You can change <span class="code">p2</span>.</p>
<pre class="code">
p1 = "World!";   // Error. Can't change the address of an array.
p2 = "World!";   // Sure. Just giving a pointer a new value.
</pre>
<p>Note that if you cause <span class="code">p2</span> to point at something else, you might loose
  the ability to access whatever <span class="code">p2</span> was pointing at before. For example
</p>
<pre class="code">
char *p2 = "Hello!";

p2 = "World!";
  /* Legal, but now there is no way to access the characters of
     "Hello!" since I don't have a variable around that contains
     the address of those characters! */
</pre>
<p>This is sometimes a concern and sometimes it isn't.</p>
<h3>The standard library</h3>
<p>Of course nearly every program ever constructed needs to copy and compare strings. To address
  this, the ANSI C standard library provides a number of useful string handling functions. You
  don't actually have to write them; they are part of the standard. To get at these functions you
  should <span class="code">#include &lt;string.h&gt;</span>. Here are a few of the important
  ones.</p>
<pre class="code">
int strlen(char *);
  /* Returns the length of the string. The null byte is not counted. */

char *strcpy(char *dest, char *source);
  /* Copies the source string to the address specified by dest. The null
     byte is also copied. Returns dest. No overflow checking is done.
     You must insure that dest has sufficient space. */

char *strcat(char *dest, char *source);
  /* Concatenates (appends) the source string onto the end of dest. The
     null byte on dest is overwritten with the first character of
     source. The null byte on source is copied. Returns dest. No
     overflow checking is done. You must insure that dest has sufficient
     space for the combined string. */

int strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
  /* Compares the elements of s1 and s2. If they all agree (up to their
     respective null bytes), this function returns zero. Otherwise it
     returns a negative value if s1 comes "before" s2 and a positive
     value of s1 comes "after" s2. */

char *strchr(char *search, int c);
  /* Searches the search string looking for a character that matches c.
     If one is found a pointer to that character inside the string is
     returned. Otherwise the special NULL pointer is returned. */

int sprintf(char *dest, char *format, ...);
  /* This function is actually declared in &lt;stdio.h&gt;. It works just like
     printf except that it "prints" its output into an array of
     characters given as the first argument. This is a handy way of
     formatting a string containing variable values without actually
     outputing it right away. It's very useful. No overflow checking is
     done. You must insure that dest has sufficient space. (NOTE: C99
     provides snprintf which takes an integer count that is used to
     limit the number of characters put into the destination array). */

int sscanf(char *source, char *format, ...);
  /* This function is also declared in &lt;stdio.h&gt;. It works just like
     scanf except that it reads characters out of a string rather than
     from the standard input device. It treats the null character at the
     end of the string as the "end-of-file". */
</pre>
<p>There are several other useful string functions in the standard library, but I consider the
  ones I mention here to be essential. You can't live without these functions. Remember them. It's
  also useful to know that there is a <span class="code">strncpy</span> and <span
      class="code">strncat</span> that take an integer parameter defining the size of the
  destination area. Those functions won't overflow the destination array. However, using them
  properly can be tricky. The <span class="code">strncpy</span> function, for example, won't null
  terminate the destination if it runs out of space. You need to do so explicitly if you care
  about that---and you most likely do. I invite you to read about these other functions when you
  need to use them. They are described in the text, but you can also read about them on-line using
  the Unix manual.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
$ <span class="user-input">man strncpy</span>
</pre>
<p>The on-line manual contains information about the C standard library as well as the Unix
  commands.</p>
<h3>What is that NULL thing?</h3>
<p>There is a special pointer, called the "null" pointer, that doesn't point at anything. Null
  pointers are not uninitialiized, but you can't use them to access a value. What good are they?
  Null pointers are often used by functions to indicate that some sort of error occured. For
  example, the <span class="code">strchr</span> function I mentioned above returns a pointer to
  the character it found. But if it doesn't find the character it returns the null pointer to
  indicate that. This is very typical.</p>
<p>You can write the null pointer in several different ways. The most basic is to just use "0" in
  your program. It would look like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
char *p = 0;   // Declare p and initialize it to the null pointer.
</pre>
<p>You can check to see if a pointer is null like this</p>
<pre class="code">
if (p == 0) { ... }
</pre>
<p>Normally you aren't supposed to put integers into pointers or compare integers and pointers.
  However, the null pointer is special. When you use "0" in the context where a pointer is
  expected the compiler understands that you mean the null pointer.</p>
<p>Many programmers find it odd to use zero to indicate the null pointer. As a result there is a
  special symbol available that you can use instead. To get at that symbol you have to include an
  appropriate header. The <span class="code">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span> header works as do a few
  others (but not all). Then you can say things like</p>
<pre class="code">
char *p = NULL;

if (p == NULL) { ... }
</pre>
<p>Notice that I have to spell NULL with all uppercase letters.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned you can use either method of representing a null pointer in your
  program. In C++, the use of just "0" is prefered. In C "NULL" is more common.</p>
<p>Notice how the null pointer doesn't have a type. The following is legal</p>
<pre class="code">
int    *p1 = NULL;
char   *p2 = NULL;
double *p3 = NULL;
</pre>
<p>It is also important to realize that the null pointer and the null character are two very
  different things. The null character is the character with an ASCII code of zero. It is usually
  written as <span class="code">'\0'</span> in a program. It is used to mark the end of a string.
  The null pointer is a pointer that doesn't point at anything. It is usually written as <span
      class="code">NULL</span> or 0 in a program. Since pointers are not characters the two ideas
  should never meet. If you try to use a null character where the null pointer is necessary, or
  visa-versa, you are likely to have compiler errors or worse.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ol id="summary-list">
  <li>
    <p>In C strings are just stored in ordinary arrays of characters. The language does not give
      strings (hardly) any special consideration. You can't compare two strings with <span
          class="code">==</span> and you can't assign one string to another with <span
          class="code">=</span>. The language treats string literals as pointers to null
      terminated anonymous arrays and does allow you to initialize an array of characters easily
      with a string literal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The essential library functions for handling strings are declared in <span
        class="code">&lt;string.h&gt;</span>. They include functions such as <span
        class="code">strlen</span>, <span class="code">strcpy</span>, <span class="code"
    >strcat</span>, <span class="code">strchr</span>, and some others. Consult the appendix of the
      text for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The null pointer is a special pointer that doesn't point at anything. In C programs it is
      typically shown as <span class="code">NULL</span>, but using <span class="code"
      >0</span> will also work. The null pointer is used in many cases to indicate an error.
      Functions that normally return a pointer often return the null pointer when they don't work.
