SUBJECT       : Pseudo code for a print formatting program.

(C) Copyright 1999 by Peter Chapin

This file contains the p-code for a filter program that will format a
file for the printer. It outputs material onto stdout. The user will
need to use I/O redirection to send the output to the printer. This is
actually a very flexible way to do things.

This program truncates long lines so that they will not wrap on the
printer.

This p-code is well refined and "ripe" for translation to a working
program. It is uses a formal notation that I created.
